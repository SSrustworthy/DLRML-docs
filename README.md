# 🎵 DLR Music Loops

Welcome to **dlrmusicloops.com** — an ongoing archival project dedicated to preserving and cataloging the background music ("BGM") loops played throughout the **Disneyland Resort**. This includes:

- Disneyland Park

- Disney(’s) California Adventure

- The Disneyland Resort Hotels

- Resort Esplanade & Main Entrance

- Downtown Disney District

These music loops help shape the atmosphere and emotional memory of a Disney visit, and this project aims to bring together **accurate, community-validated tracklists** for reference and historical preservation.

Thanks to the incredible Disney parks music fan community, past and present, who took the time to document what others only heard in passing. This project wouldn’t exist without your dedication.
