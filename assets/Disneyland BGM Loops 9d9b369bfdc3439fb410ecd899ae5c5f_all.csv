Main Street U.S.A.,Main Street U.S.A. v.1 [PRE],Unknown,"This exact loop is unverified, but is here as a placeholder for 1971-1976. This was a short reel composed of the album “Gay Nineties Waltzes” that was initially created for WDW’s 1971 opening. An anecdote from DL FLIGHT 295 offers that it definitely featured “Man on the Flying Trapeze,” which was removed from the 1976 loops.

Adventureland,Jungle Cruise Queue v.1,Unknown,"This loop played in the original Jungle Cruise queue. MightyTriton on Magic Music said “I also remember waiting in line under the grass thatched huts and there was a music loop in there. Music from African tribes played non stop. I remember trying to differentiate the songs from one another but they all sounded the same to me. The speakers were spread out and near the end of the switchbacks. The volume wasn't that loud unless you were directly under one of the speakers, so it did not interfere with all of the jungle sounds too much.” The Kenster said “There was the African Tribe music loop in the old Jungle Cruise queue. I couldn't tell one song from another.” See Magic Music, Re: https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/jungle-cruise-queue-bgm.3691/page-2 (2008) and https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/disneyland-music-loops.17/page-3 (2002).",1,See loop notes,,,,,,,,,

Additional note from Djali999: Tracks did randomly pop in and out of loops in those days back when everything was being copied by hand onto reel-to-reel tapes which would degrade with time, so the missing tracks may or may not have been present at various points. This is the case most famously with the Big Thunder Mt queue loop, which is missing one track in Disneyland which was included in the Florida loop.

The loop has a runtime of 00:27:41.262 and is entirely comprised of instrumental score and song instrumentals from the Sleeping Beauty animated film. Unfortunately the loop contains a high amount of unreleased score, and so compiling a tracklist is all but impossible.

New Orleans Square,Club 33 Le Salon Noveau,N/A,"StarWarsGalaxysEdge noted: “Le Salon Nouveau features a Yamaha Disklavier (a reproducing piano) playing a mixture of jazz classics with a couple of Disney tunes thrown into the mix. I've noticed that its playback system does not follow the traditional ""loop"" model; rather, tracks can be shuffled and have smooth transitions between each other, almost as if a real person is playing the piano. Additionally, there is a prop instrument placed on each side of the bar — a trumpet and a clarinet — as well as in-ceiling speakers located on both sides of the room, which provide the appropriate trumpet/clarinet piece to whatever song the piano is playing. Although the piano is technically ""live"", there are a few speakers that broadcast the instrument throughout the lounge. All of the music that plays in the lounge was composed for the club”.

Bayou Country,Tiana's Bayou Adventure queue [REF],01:18:05.336,"This loop is audible throughout the exterior and interior queue of Tiana’s Bayou Adventure. The loop presented as a radio show hosted by an unseen announcer. The announcements reference local businesses featured in the queue and attraction. The announcer also transitions between fictional bands and songs on the ""live"" broadcast, featuring performances from the Blue Bayou Horn Blowers, Riverbank Royals, Blue Sky Social Club, Hot Sauce 7, and Claiborne Avenue Cats. In actuality, the music was arranged and/or played by many modern New Orleans-based musicians, including Charlie Gabriel, Leah Chase-Kamata, Preservation Hall Jazz Band, and Dirty Dozen Brass Band.
