Many of the Orchestral Collection tracks are edited in a similar fashion to their appearances in other DLH loops. Loop removed in either 2010 or 2011. Based on a reference recording by CThaddeus from August 2010 and compiled by C33.

My guess would be that this was an arrangement done for Shanghai Disneyland, but I haven’t been able to confirm that. This track is also part of the Caribbean Plaza area BGM used at WDW's Magic Kingdom since the ride was updated to include Jack Sparrow; that loop runs 56:25 and the track in question plays between ""You Look Good Jack"" from Dead Man's Chest and ""Up is Down"" from At World's End.

This track is featured in the Tokyo Disneyland Tomorrowland BGM but is NOT included in the Disneyland or Magic Kingdom versions of the loop; nevertheless it was included on the 2006 Official Albums for both Disneyland (“Remember the Moments”) and Walt DIsney World (“Where Magic Lives”); it’s inclusion in the Esplanade loop marks the first time its played at Disneyland.

This version of the music was originally arranged for Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade Dreamlights by Greg Smith. The arrangement here differs very slightly however from the version featured in Dreamlights (most mixes include character voices and SFX, so you’d specifically want the Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade Dreamlights: Show Mix Edition CD, which includes a “Music Piece Edition” without character voices or SFX), and the TDL mix also includes crossfades in and out of the loop. There is a rehearsal CD for the 2010 DCA version of the parade in circulation, but that includes the Tinker Bell pixie dust SFX at several points during the float loop, which isn’t present in the Esplanade loop. You could use an induction of the parade underliner to recreate this track, or you could probably get very very close by editing together the TDL and rehearsal CD tracks.",,,,"April 1, 2017",

The album version has a runtime of 3:57; the loop version is edited to exclude 1:03-2:30 of the album track.

The loop version cuts about 2.5 seconds off the opening fade in in order to fade in faster. As I’ve noted before, while all releases of Fantastic! include the exit music, only the original Walt Disney World CD release features it as it’s own separate track, with a running time of 3:02; some non-theme park compilations have also included it, such as A Musical Tour: Treasure of the Walt Disney Archivist the Reagan Library (available on iTunes), which has a running time of 2:58.",,,,"April 1, 2017",

A slightly curious choice since that version of the film hasn’t played at Disneyland since June 2016, having been replaced with the new Soarin’ Around The World film and a new score by Bruce Broughton.

That loop, which runs 30:11 includes both tracks from the Monsters Inc OST and new arrangements, this track is one of the new arrangements, appearing in that loop in between edits “School” and “Randall Appears,” both from the OST.

Esplanade-Main Gates,Esplanade v.3,,,31,Steamboat Willie,,Disneyland Resort Official Album   2013 ,0:52,"This track is from the Mickey’s Toontown BGM loop; it was included in Disneyland Forever and has appeared on a number of official albums including the most recent one, with a running time of 2:08. The loop version starts 1:17 into the album track. Annoyingly there is one small difference between the loop version and the album version- the loop version features a two part ratchet sound effects; the album version only includes the second part of this sound effect. It’s an odd difference, and all the album versions of the track I’ve checked have been identical.",,,,"April 1, 2017",
