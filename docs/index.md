*Have you ever wondered what that synth pop music was playing in the queue for the Autopia?* 

*Did you know that PeopleMover music used to play in the Superstar Limo queue?*

*Just how many different loops used tunes from The Beach Boys in the early days of Disney's California Adventure?*

If these questions pique your interest, you're in the right place!

This site was created to house track lists of background music (“BGM”) from the Disneyland Resort, namely Disneyland Park, Disney(’s) California Adventure, and the Resort hotels. 

With the help of several knowledgeable and kind friends, I have tried my best to aggregate **accurate and validated tracklists** in one location for reference purposes. These lists have been posted in forums and blog posts around the internet (see [Helpful Sources](resources/helpful_sources.md)).

So with that said, the databases for Disneyland, Disney(’s) California Adventure, the Disneyland Main Gates, the Resort Esplanade, the Resort Hotels, and the Downtown Disney District are all [available to peruse!](explore/welcome.md).

If you're interested in listening to accurate reconstructions of park BGM loops, you can check out the **Hometown Sounds of Main Street, U.S.A. channel** on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@HometownSoundsMSUSA/featured), with curated playlists by park and land.
