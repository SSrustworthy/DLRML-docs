## *Listen to accurate, high-quality BGM reconstructions!*

While this site is primarily for text-based track lists of background music from the parks, I compile enough “reconstructions” of park loops in the process of IDing them that we decided to add our work to the YouTube scene. 

As a collaborative effort between myself (SSrustworthy) and fellow MouseBits member StarWarsGalaxysEdge, we have created a new YouTube channel, “Hometown Sounds of Main Street, U.S.A.” where we post faithful reconstructions with proper recording attributions (lined up with original recordings in a digital audio workstation (DAW), with proper edits, track versions, and runtimes!) of park BGM.

Enjoy our ad-free reconstructions and playlists on our YouTube channel:
