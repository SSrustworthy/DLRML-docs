# How to Contribute

Welcome! This section of the site is dedicated to those who want to help expand 
and refine the collection of background music loops from Disney parks. 
Whether you're a seasoned collector, a curious fan, or someone with 
access to vintage recordings, your contributions would add great value to this archive.

## What We're Looking For

We are actively seeking help identifying and verifying music loops 
from various areas of the parks. These include both well-known and 
obscure locations, some of which are no longer in operation.

Some loops are discussed more specifically here:

- For loops specific to **Disney California Adventure**, check out [DCA - Looking for These Loops](dca_looking_for.md).
- For loops from **Disneyland**, including shops, restaurants, and attractions, see [DL - Looking for These Loops](dl_looking_for.md).

Each page lists locations where we have incomplete or missing information. If you recognize a track, have a recording, or can confirm details, please reach out!

## Acknowledgments

This site would not be what it is without the contributors of several kind folks. They have taught me a lot and kindly shared tracklists and recordings with me and the broader community.
