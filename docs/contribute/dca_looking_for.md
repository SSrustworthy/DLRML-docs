# DCA - Looking for These Loops!

There are several loops for which I have minimal to no information about.  If you can assist in identifying these tracks, please [contact me](../contact.md) or start a post on [MouseBits](https://forums.mousebits.com/)!

## Lamplight Lounge (restaurant interior)

In search of any tracks played here.

## Sorcerer’s Workshop: Beast’s Library

I’ve heard it mentioned that the tracks include Transformation #1 (The Music Behind the Magic), Transformation (soundtrack version), Beast Lets Belle Go, and The West Wing but I haven’t been able to confirm these.

## (Wolfgang Puck’s) Avalon Cove (restaurant interior)

I have a list of songs supposedly played here, but no reference recording to ID albums against. It’s likely that this list came directly from an inquiry to Guest Relations, and no artists were ever provided.

## Blue Sky Cellar

- Mickey & the Magical Map (2013)
- Market House (Starbucks Conversion) (2013)
- Pixar Pier - Blue Sky Cellar exhibition opened April 13, 2018

## Ahwahnee Camp Circle Loops

Missing all loops after “The Magic of Brother Bear”.
