These websites all provide various playlists and track compilations of music that has played at the Disney Parks, both past and present. They proved invaluable in my compilation efforts.

## MouseBits Forum

This park music discussion forum really took off circa 2011-2012. It maintains a great torrent seeding resource for many live recordings and several of the more commonly circulated, non-commercially-available pieces of Disney parks music.

Additionally, I've archived my MouseBits posts (at least, the more informative ones...) on the left hand side.

## Disney Music Loops

Kirsten Wahlquist’s original site for all compiled park loops. The site has not been updated since circa 2005.

## Magic Music Forums

Formerly titled Magic Music of the Mouse, this discussion forum is an especially great archive for park music discussions that occurred between 2002 and 2010. Even Randy Thorton, the former producer of many official park albums, made a consistent appearance to engage with members.

## Disneyland Resort Music Compendium

## Capitol Media and Production Music

Thanks to the involvement of LA-area DJ Jack Wagner in the early music loops of Disneyland and Walt Disney World, the Capitol Records production music lines played an important role in Disneyland history and are featured in loops to this day.
