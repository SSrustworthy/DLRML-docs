# Capitol Media & Production Music

Disneyland has some interesting connections to the various lines of “Production Music” and “Media Music” created by Ole Georg and associates at Capitol Records in the latter half of the 20th century. A good writeup on the subject as it relates to Walt Disney World’s early Tomorrowland music can be found on the [**Passport to Dreams blog**](http://passport2dreams.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-early-music-of-tomorrowland.html).

Unfortunately, the vinyl records as part of these collections are not in common circulation as the music was licensed out back in the day. These records now pop up inconsistently on sites like ebay, and all efforts to provide information on the various releases over the years are marred by rereleases and discontinuations. As such, there’s several variations of records floating around out there.

As a general enthusiast of the various Capitol lines myself, I’ve created some databases of reel and package images in efforts so we can try to catalogue these differences. The most complete are the Hi-”Q” and Media Music databases, linked below. I hope these are a helpful resource!

## *Where was production music used at the Disneyland Resort?*

Capitol Records production music has been documented as playing onboard the Peoplemover, in the Superstar Limo queue, at the original Main Gates of Disneyland, in the Enchanted Tiki Room Dole Video, at the Autopia Grandstand, and at the stockade entrance to Frontierland. Check out the track listing databases for more information on what specific production tracks played in each location.
