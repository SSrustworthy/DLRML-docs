## How can I determine what year a specific reel was released?

[According to](https://librarymusicthemes.com/index.php?topic=222.0) Library Music Themes forum member Mr, these reels were all manufactured through Capitol Custom. Their catalog numbering system can be used to decipher the original release dates.

Using the Catalog Number entry in our [images database](capitol.md), the first two letters correspond to a given year. For example, Reel L-1/L-2 are cataloged as "GB-4137/GB-4138", indicating a release year of 1957.
