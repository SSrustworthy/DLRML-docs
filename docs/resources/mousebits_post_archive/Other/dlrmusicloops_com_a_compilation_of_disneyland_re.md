# dlrmusicloops.com - A compilation of Disneyland Resort Tracklists

*Posted by SSrustworthy on 11/10/24*

A few months back marked the two-year anniversary of the current cornerstone of my hobbies - the creation of a comprehensive database of music loops played at the Disneyland Resort. I apparently never got around to posting about it on here even amidst the many track lists that I've posted in that timeframe.

For context, I first discovered Mousebits in high school, likely through one of the Disneyland blogs that were prevalent back in the 2000s-2010s. I remember lurking around on the forums (under a different username) and contributing incomplete track compilations (not tracklists) to the bygone ffshrine forums. I remember being very proud of the work I did on finding free downloads of tracks for the Carsland and Main Street Christmas loops üòÖ. I even attempted to do some of the Mickey's Toontown Holiday loop edits with a free app on my phone! In general, I loved having music loops on while I worked so I could feel transported to a different time and place.

That Disney music interest faded after a few years and life moved onward. On a visit to the parks in July of 2022, I got to thinking about my old hobby and wondered how MouseBits was holding up. I found something of a ghost town and now a relic of the early 2010s. This decrease in activity, a product of declining interest in newer park music and lack of newer source material that could slip through the cracks to collectors. I realized that all of the music loops that had been posted over the years here were vulnerable to disappearing, and the fact that they were locked behind a login wall meant that they might not be archived by the wayback machine. 

I decided to act.

I scoured Magic Music and MouseBits for any and all tracklists and clues about bygone loops I could find. I looked at my downloads from the torrents and maps of the park over the years to ensure I didn't miss anything. I became a Disneyland Music Loop Expert through my many hours spent on the forums üòé 

I started compiling everything into a few Notion databases for easy viewing. The ‚Äúdatabase‚Äù is now at 200 Disneyland loops (not counting the Disney Gallery loops), 137 DCA loops, and 44 other resort loops (e.g. main gates, esplanade, DTD). The tracklists are in various states of completion, and the database will never truly be complete, but it‚Äôs certainly the most complete compilation available outside of WDI.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed over the last few years, especially pixelated, IHeartGaming, wedroy1923 (his [OG site](https://disney-parks-music-compendium.blogspot.com/p/disneyland-resort.html) was an inspiration with additional information not found on the forums!), sorker, StarWarsGalaxysEdge, and VJ. I‚Äôm lucky to have found such a great community for a hobby that is near to my heart.

# The Site

The DLR loops database is available at [https://dlrmusicloops.com/](https://dlrmusicloops.com/).

If the database seems to not load, try refreshing the page. This is a known issue and my hope is to transfer everything to github pages. For the time being, this is still largely usable. 

The database is also available to download¬†[here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7259055)¬†in CSV form. I aim to update the github archive bi-annually.
