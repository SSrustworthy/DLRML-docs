*Posted by SSrustworthy on July 3, 2023*

The Disney100 esplanade music debuted at the Disneyland Resort on January 25, 2023 for the Disney100 celebration. It’s an amalgamation of entertainment and attraction tracks from the Disneyland and Walt Disney World Resorts.

Thanks to StarWarsGalaxysEdge for sharing his tracklist.

Please see MagicalSoundtracks’ YT channel for an accurate reconstruction of the music:
