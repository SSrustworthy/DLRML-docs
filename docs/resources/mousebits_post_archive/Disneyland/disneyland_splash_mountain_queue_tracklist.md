# Disneyland Splash Mountain Queue Tracklist

*Posted by SSrustworthy on June 18, 2024*

A tracklist for the Splash Mountain Queue loop, based on a live recording of the exit provided by pixelated. The track times include silences between tracks, which are typically ~1 second long.

wedroy1923 [noted the following](https://disney-parks-music-compendium.blogspot.com/2022/11/splash-mountain-queue-bgm.html) about the origins of this loop:

*An earlier version of this playlist appeared ca. 2003 - ca. 2007 on [DisneyMusicLoops](https://disneymusicloops.tripod.com/dlr/dlr-cc-cc.html) (disneymusicloops.com).*

*In 08/2020, Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah was removed from the loop. The rest of the loop continued to play in the same order until the attraction's final day of operation on May 30, 2023.*

Additional notes: Unlike the rest of the loop, the elusive Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah #2 was not released on Disneyland Forever, but is the same track as below, sped to 1.027 speed. The recording session version is also circulating as

*Critter Country Area Music - Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah (Version 1).mp3*

and is about 1.005 times the speed of the queue version. All other tracks in the tracklist align perfectly with the DLF versions.
