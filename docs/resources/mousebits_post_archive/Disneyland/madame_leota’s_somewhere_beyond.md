# Madame Leota’s Somewhere Beyond

*Posted by SSrustworthy on 2/22/25 [here](https://forums.mousebits.com/threads/madame-leotas-somewhere-beyond.11082/)*

Madame Leota’s Somewhere Beyond opened as the exit gift shop for the Haunted Mansion on December 23, 2024. The loop plays from speakers high overhead. It consists of several heavily edited Audio Network tracks alongside SFX consisting of trumpet/drum/harp/bell sounds, as well as short interstitial melodies and snippets of HM on-ride music. These can be overlaid on top of the tracks, appear to "pause" a track for a few seconds or longer, or conjoin adjacent tracks (similar to the musical segments conjoining the DL Mickey's Toontown BGM).

A live six minute snippet of the shop music was released as part of a Park Sensory podcast (repeated twice in this episode by whoever was recording):

Thanks to pixelated for making a reference recording and initial tracklist to aid in the investigation of this heavily edited loop.

A complete tracklist, sans edits, is below. If edits are of interest, let me know, but I providing a reconstruction below with largely intact edits (aside for a small amount -seconds worth- of adjustment for listenability).
