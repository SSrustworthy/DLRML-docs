This is a list of tracks that I have identified using Google Sound Search from YT videos of the new shop in NOS. A reference recording is still needed to properly ID tracks, but this is a pretty good start! These tracks I've listed below are not necessarily in order. I often heard the same track in multiple videos, but I only recorded one video per track as a reference.

This seems to be a collection of tracks reflective of New Orleans-style jazz, although some tracks are clearly from the 2000's (ironic given that The Princess and the Frog supposedly took place in the 1920's... I guess they have an audience to appeal to).
