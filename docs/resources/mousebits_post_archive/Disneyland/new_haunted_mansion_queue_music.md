# New Haunted Mansion Queue Music

*Posted by SSrustworthy on 1/23/25*

The Haunted Mansion began playing a custom queue loop in the new exterior extended queue area in late November 2024. Variations on a central track play in sync across the 3 (at least) different areas of the queue, which includes Master Gracey’s Garden, Madame Leota’s Garden, the Mansion Greenhouse. The music was composed by [Ego Plum](https://www.egoplum.com/). A sample of his work for the queue music is [here](https://www.laughingplace.com/w/disney-parks/ego-plum-haunted-mansion-queue-soundtrack/).

Note, it is unverified whether there is a fourth section (as there are supposedly 40+ minutes of new music).

elecTRONrabbit has reported that one section is 10:06 long.

All sections were recorded live (albeit incomplete) by the Park Sensory podcast/YT channel:
