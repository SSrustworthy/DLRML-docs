# Pinocchio’s Daring Journey Queue

*Posted by SSrustworthy on July 21, 2024*

A complete tracklist for Pinocchio’s Daring Journey queue loop. There have been general descriptions of the queue as well as a presumably source file in circulation, but I wanted to try and piece it together for a fuller picture. I used several queue recordings from the Walking With the Mouse YouTube channel.
