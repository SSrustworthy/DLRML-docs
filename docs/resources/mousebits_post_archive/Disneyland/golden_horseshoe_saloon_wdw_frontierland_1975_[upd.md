# Golden Horseshoe Saloon / WDW Frontierland 1975 [UPDATED]

*Posted by SSrustworthy 5/18/24*

*Updated 6/9/24*

The most recent interstitial music in the Golden Horseshoe Saloon seems to have been playing since at lease 2022 (per observations by pixelated). This loop appears to be a very close relative of the Walt Disney World Frontierland 1975 loop, which has been partially pieced together via fragmented recordings [1]. By association, this  loop also played at a Chip and Dale Meet and Greet in the central plaza near Rancho del Zocalo Restaurante in the mid/late 90s [2]. When compared with the WDW 1975 Frontierland loop, it matches all of the identified tracks besides the replacement of ‚ÄúBile ‚Äôem Cabbage Down‚Äù with the unreleased CBJ Stoneman Family track ‚ÄúHome on the Range‚Äù.

Many of the tracks in this loop appear to come from the Capitol Records production music libraries, specifically two records in the Media Music line [3]. I was able to track these down via some sleuthing and my preexisting familiarity with the behemoth of Media Music üòõ They can be found on three records in the Media Music Line:

1. MEDS-4 - Media Music Release No. 2 - No. 4 - Western Themes/Fun Marches [Hi-Q equivalent Reel X-75/76]
2. MEGS-5 - Media Music Release No. 7 - No. 5 - Solo Instruments [Reel X-145/146 or OGM Archives 4]
3. MECS-8 - Media Music Release No. 6 - No. 8 - Special Occasions / Country & Western [Reel X-135/136]

Some tracks from the first and third albums were released on the OGM Music album CD-MMXM-104 - Travel The World/Country/Western [4] which was released on Ole Georg Music's The Professional Line as Compact Disc 5. Are you confused yet??

There is one unknown track. It is a particularly lonely duet of a harmonica and accordion. I have excised the track for convenience. A close mic of the speaker or a live recording of the louder speaker downstairs would prove very useful in identification efforts, as it‚Äôs a fairly quiet track.

UPDATE: This track has been identified as a presumed Stoneman Family track associated with the Country Bear Jamboree / Mile Long Bar. It remains unnamed; see below. The track is likely¬†~~"Come Back Paddy Reilly."~~¬†**Farewell To The Mountain**¬†from the Davy Crockett series (thanks to Chris Lyndon!).

In order to ID the loop I put several live recordings together to make it easier to hear. I did record the entirety of the loop in one sitting but I attracted a ton of interference in my recorder as I had placed it on a table for most of the duration, so I made the new version where I limited the interference sounds where possible. It‚Äôs not great but certainly works for a reference.

All tracks have been verified with side-by-side references in a DAW. Some tracks are a slower/faster tempo than their re-released counterparts, but I did not mark that here.

Post on 6/9:

Well hot dog! The unknown track seems to be another Stoneman Family track. It is included on this recording from the Disneyland Mile Long Bar on waltsmusic.com starting at 7:18.

[Disneyland Mile Long Bar Music #4](https://waltsmusic.com/index.php/jack-wagner-collection/disneyland-mile-long-bar-music-4?highlight=WyJtaWxlIl0=)

No name yet, but I will try to do more sleuthing as the recorded CBJ BGM tracks seem to be American folk songs (asides from Bang! Goes Old Betsy).

Note that with the discovery of the source track, there is no longer a huge silent gap and so the beginning of the loop is now arbitrary.

Edit:¬†The track seems to be strongly related to the Irish folk tune "Come Back Paddy Reilly". Different performances of the tune by various groups do not always have a consistently slow tempo, but this rendition showcases the strong similarities.
