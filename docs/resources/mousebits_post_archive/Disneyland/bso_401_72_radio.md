Here's a full lowdown from a recording that pixelated did earlier in January (I did one too but I shoved the mic in a rosemary bush in the rain and it sounded much more muffled than his).

Original post:

The BSO 401.72 radio show (AKA Black Spire Outpost radio) plays at Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge and consists of coverage of droid battles, dejarik tournaments and outlawed podraces interspersed with radio tracks from DJ R3X. It previously played in the bathrooms behind the Milk Stand, and in the garage and suspended walkway outside the marketplace. Apparently, the radio loop no longer plays audibly outdoors. There is a somewhat accessible speaker in the top of the doorway to the restrooms behind the milk stand that is still playing the audio, but it sounds distorted. 

pixelated recorded a test live loop recording of 2 hours and 19 minutes which did not show a repeat point. I went through his recording and identified the following tracks (which played with interspersed commentary, advertisements, etc.). I provided links to the unreleased tracks in my previous post on R3X's setlist.

1. Huttuk Cheeka
2. Bright Suns
3. Unknown 1
4. Til the Spire
5. Doshka
6. Unknown 2
7. Turbulence
8. Oola Shuka
9. Droid World
10. Nama Heh
11. Unknown 3
12. Shakawalla
13. Unknown 4
14. Beep Boop Bop
15. Unknown 5
16. Unknown 6
17. Utinni
18. Unknown 7
19. Aloogahoo
20. Modal Notes
21. Moulee-Rah [R]
22. Mad About Mad About Me
23. Unknown 8
24. Bai Tee Tee
25. Unknown 9
26. Doolstan
27. Unknown 10
28. Una Duey Dee
29. Unknown 11
30. Batuu Boogie
31. Goola Bukee
32. Unknown 12
33. Gaya Kaminu
34. Unknown 13

Additional notes: Every track on the released album was audible in this partial recording except for Yocola Ateema, which tells me that the radio loop probably isn’t too much longer than what pixelated captured. I don’t recall hearing the unreleased track dubbed by fans as “Rasta-far-far-away-ian.” The track “Gaya” never showed up either, although “Gaya Kaminu” did. No tracks were repeated, although sometimes short comments from the announcer or R3X were (”That’s one of my favorite songs ever!”).

The 13 unknown tracks, excised from pixelated’s recording, can be heard here (FLAC format):
