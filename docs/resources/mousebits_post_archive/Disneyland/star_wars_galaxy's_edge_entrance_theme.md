# Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge Entrance Theme

*Posted by SSrustworthy on 10/25/24*

This 'Entrance Theme' plays at all three entrance points to SW:GE at Frontierland, Critter Country, and Fantasyland. The full track is actually posted on Randy Kerber’s [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/adam-michalak-1/star-wars-galaxys-edge-entrance-theme).

I made a recording last time I went and got a loop runtime of 00:04:54.306, and found that there's a bit of overlap in the original track to produce the following loop:

**DL - Star Wars Galaxy's Edge - Transition Zone (reconstruction).flac**

And my live recording:

**DL - SWGE - Transition Zone (live, take 1).m4a**
