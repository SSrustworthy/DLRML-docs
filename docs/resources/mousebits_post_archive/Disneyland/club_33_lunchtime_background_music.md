# Club 33 Lunchtime Background Music

*Posted by SSrustworthy on 06/23/24*

This loop began playing at Club 33 upon reopening on July 18, 2014. It plays during the lunch hours in the Court of Angels up through Le Grand Salon, covering much of the ground of the original Club. Le Salon Nouveau is said to have a different loop. 

Given the first set of track ID’s by circlevision91 and the estimated loop length, starwarsgalaxysedge determined that the loop was likely the WDW Port Orleans loop with a high degree of certainty.  All ten of those IDs matched the 34-track Port Orleans loop, with the remaining three matching the Dinner loop as recorded by starwarsgalaxysedge. The following tracklist has been compiled based on a recording by sorker.

The recording was paused for about a minute during a song transition, so the loop length is approximate. Blue and Broken Hearted was chosen as the first track as the long fade out after Delta Bound makes for a more natural loop ending. Any gaps between tracks feel otherwise purposeful to space out the tracks.

My and starwarsgalaxysedge’s reconstruction is on YouTube:
