This loop plays throughout the "Through the Ears" and outdoor extended MMRR queue. The loop is dynamic and the instrumentation changes between exhibits (Early Ears: early jazz, Golden Ears: modern jazz, and Modern Ears: orchestral). It does not play in the area immediately surrounding the Disco Mickey Mouse exhibit. It consists of rearrangements of themes associated with Mickey and Minnie Mouse.

Track names verified by Christopher Willis via Twitter/SoundCloud except for the last unknown (which will hopefully be named in the near future). All SoundCloud source tracks in compressed quality are available here alongside WDW queue tracks:
