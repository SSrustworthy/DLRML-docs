# Pioneer Mercantile v.4

*Posted by SSrustworthy on 8/7/2024*

A preliminary track list for the Pioneer Mercantile back-of-store video loop. I have not verified the loop against its source tracks. This version of the Pioneer Mercantile video loop was introduced ca. 2022 (see [dlnewstoday](https://dlnewstoday.com/2022/09/encanto-and-the-muppets-added-to-frontierland-shop-in-disneyland/)).

The reference recording patches two recordings together during We Donâ€™t Talk About Bruno, but I have patched together the split recordings using the source track as a reference.

An aside, the Ballad of Big Thunder Mountain was released as an audio-only via Disneyland Forever, so it has a glorified powerpoint to accompany it in this compilation.
