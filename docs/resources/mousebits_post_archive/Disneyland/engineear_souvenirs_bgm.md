# EngineEAR Souvenirs BGM

*Posted by SSrustworthy on 4/4/25*

A confirmed tracklist for the EngineEAR Souvenirs BGM with reference recording.  Almost all tracks include a short train sfx after/before the track. These consist of crossing bells, train whistles, chugging, and steam release sfx. The longest is ~14 seconds but are usually ~5 seconds. I didnâ€™t include song lengths as a result, but the full reference recording is below. 

The unedited version is below, but I did want to note that I had some success putting portions of the recording through tunebat to remove conversations from different points, making track beginnings/endings and SFX clearer. This like a promising solution for future live reference recordings near chatty guests.
