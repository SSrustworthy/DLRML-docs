# Tiana’s Bayou Adventure

*Posted by SSrustworthy on 2/28/25*

This loop is audible throughout the exterior and interior queue of Tiana’s Bayou Adventure. The loop presented as a radio show hosted by an unseen announcer.  The announcements reference local businesses featured in the queue and attraction, including B. Jolleys (a box of sweets is in the queue and used by a frog from Ranitas Verdes), Wong Family Groves (written on a calendar), Mais Baits (a bait box is used by one of the Ranitas Verdes frogs), Addeman Mills (a company visible on a flour bag or two in the queue), and Ranitas Verdes (club from the attraction). The announcer also transitions between fictional bands and songs on the "live" broadcast, featuring performances from the Blue Bayou Horn Blowers, Riverbank Royals, Blue Sky Social Club, Hot Sauce 7, and Claiborne Avenue Cats. In actuality, the music was arranged and/or played by many modern New Orleans-based musicians, including Charlie Gabriel, Leah Chase-Kamata, Preservation Hall Jazz Band, and Dirty Dozen Brass Band. 

Some footage of the queue music recording sessions is visible in the [Soundscapes](https://youtu.be/BSzRyCC_EaU?feature=shared) episode from the "We Call It Imagineering" YouTube series, timestamps 11:12 - 15:37 ([bonus](https://youtu.be/guBDN0NkS1Q?feature=shared)). You can also hear a portion of the queue programming in the [live recording posted](https://youtu.be/lEuSmqf-n_Q?feature=shared) on the Park Sensory YouTube Channel.

While we assume that it is the same or similar to the WDW queue, we have not verified this with a live recording from WDW.

Thanks to pixelated for graciously sharing his recording of the queue music.

## Transcript of Radio Announcements

1. Thank you for joining us here at WNO New Orleans. That was “It Ain't My Fault” by the Blue Bayou Horn Blowers; what a treat that was. Now who's in the mood for a little Zydeco? I don't know about you, but this music always has me glowin’ like a firefly. Lucky for us, we have the Riverbank Royals with “Gonna Take You There!”
2. You're listenin’ to WNO New Orleans. Merci beaucoup to the Riverbank Royals for their performance of “Gonna Take You There.” Speaking of which, you can take yourself to Tiana's Foods to meet Princess Tiana! All the big bands are booked and she needs your help finding musicians for tonight's big party. Tell her I sent you! Our next band looks like they're just about ready. Here's the Blue Sky Social Club with a local favorite, “Down in New Orleans.”
3. This is WNO and that was “Down in New Orleans.” Speaking of this fine city, Princess Tiana is throwing a party for everyone in it. But, due to an unfortunate mix-up, she needs help finding a band. For any of you folks available, meet the princess at Tiana's Foods and join her search. Now, the Blue Sky Social Club will be joined by the one and only Duchess Leah singing “Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?” Take it away, Duchess.
4. You're listenin’ to WNO and that was Duchess Leah singing, with the Blue Sky Social Club, “Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?” And I do know what it means to miss New Orleans! I once visited my uncle Charlie who lives 2 hours away and it was the longest weekend of my life. I'm never leaving this city. Next up, we have another one from the Blue Sky Social Club. Here's “Li’l Liza Jane.”
5. Thank you for tuning in to WNO New Orleans. You were just listening to the Blue Sky Social Club playing “Li’l Liza Jane.” This performance is sponsored in part by Wong Family Groves, offering the finest produce in the Crescent City and a proud partner of Tiana's Foods. Speaking of which, Princess Tiana needs help looking for musicians for her big party tonight. So, if you're available, be sure to meet her there. Now, here's “Ma Belle Evangeline” performed once again by the Blue Sky Social Club.
6. This is WNO New Orleans, and that was “Ma Belle Evangeline.” The last time Princess Tiana visited our station, she told a fantastical tale about a firefly named Ray who fell in love with a star named Evangeline. I still think of those two every time I look up into that big night sky. Here's another tune by the Blue Sky Social Club called “St. James.“
7. Thank you for listening to WNO New Orleans. That was the Blue Sky Social Club with “St. James.” For those of you like myself who enjoy a little fishing, be sure to get your metal minnows from Mais Baits. If they looked any more real, they might bite back. Next up is “Basin Street Blues,” once again by the Blue Sky Social Club.
8. You're listening to WNO New Orleans and that was “Basin Street Blues.” Speaking of the blues, I want to make sure Princess Tiana doesn't come down with a case of them. She needs help finding musicians for her big party tonight. So, if you're able, go on and meet her at Tiana's Foods and lend her a hand. We have one last tune by the Blue Sky Social Club. This is “When We're Human.” Take it away.
9. Thank you for listening to WNO New Orleans. That was the Blue Sky Social Club ending another brilliant performance with “When We're Human.” Word is, that's Louis the alligator's song. If y'all know Louis, you know he doesn't need to be human. That gator is one cool cat exactly as he is. Looks like our next band is just about finished setting up. Without any further ado, here is Devon from the Hot Sauce 7 performing “Frankie and Johnny.”
10. You're listenin’ to WNO New Orleans, and that was “Frankie and Johnny” performed by Devon from the Hot Sauce 7. While they get ready for their final tune, be sure to grab yourself a B. Jolley. For a quick sweet treat, now's the best time to get your Jolleys. Once again, here's Devon from the Hot Sauce 7 performing Big Chief.
11. You're listenin’ to WNO New Orleans; that was Devon from the Hot Sauce 7 with Big Chief, and wooooo! That piece was cooking! So spicy and delicious, it reminded me of Princess Tiana's hot sauce. That stuff is *magic*. Next on the lineup is the Claiborne Avenue Cats with a New Orleans favorite, “Bourbon Street Parade. “
12. Thank you for tuning in to WNO New Orleans; that was “Bourbon Street Parade.“ Those of you who are free right now should parade on over to Tiana’s Foods and help Princess Tiana find musicians for her big party tonight. Y'all could be just what the doctor ordered. Speaking of which, here's “Doctor Jazz” once again performed by the Claiborne Avenue Cats.
13. You're listening to WNO New Orleans and that was “Doctor Jazz” by the Claiborne Avenue Cats. Other than music, nothing cures a sour mood like a tasty beignet or some other sweet treats. Nobody knows this better than Princess Tiana, which is why she uses Addeman Mills for all of her baking needs. Now, here's another tune by the Claiborne Avenue Cats called “Louisiana Fairytale.”
14. You’re tuned into WNO New Orleans and that was “Louisiana Fairytale.” As many of you know, Princess Tiana is at the heart of this city's own fairy tale, and you could be a part of it. Help her find musicians for her big party tonight, and you can make another dream of hers come true. Next up is “Eh La Bas,” once again, by the Claiborne Avenue Cats.
15. Bonjour madame and monsieur! Comment ça va? Je vais bien, merci. You were just listening to “Eh La Bas” here on WNO New Orleans, which got me hoppin’ all over the studio. Say, if you like to cut a rug [cut er’ up?] like I do, then you should check out the bands playin’ at Ranitas Verdes. The music at that club is sure to have you hoppin’, too. But enough of my ramblin’. Here's one last tune from the Claiborne Avenue Cats with their rendition of “Tailgate Ramble.“
16. Hello there. Thank you for joining us on WNO New Orleans; that was the Claiborne Avenue Cats with “Tailgate Ramble.” Another sensational performance as always. Wait, wait. Can y'all hear that? Mmmm. Now that is one tasty beat. Y'all have to excuse me while I join this second line which is formed in the hallways of our studio. This here is the Blue Bayou Horn Blowers.
17. *No intro for They All Ask'd For You*
18. Next up from these talented folks is “It Ain’t My Fault,” which is what I’ll be sayin’ if I have to get up and start dancing again!

## Reconstruction

Our reconstruction (sans “Frankie and Johnny” and radio announcements) is here:

Update —

Also, while the specific recording of "Frankie and Johnny" is unreleased, the featured pianist on the queue track, Kyle Roussel, released a cover of the song on his album "Nola À La Mode." While the recording is not note-for-note identical to his playing used recorded for the queue music, it's definitely the same arrangement and worth checking out.
