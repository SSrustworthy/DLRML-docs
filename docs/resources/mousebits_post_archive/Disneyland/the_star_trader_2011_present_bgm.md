# The Star Trader 2011 - Present BGM

*Posted by SSrustworthy on 2/23/23, updated 10/19/24*

To coincide with the (re)opening of Star Tours: The Adventures Continue, the greatest trading post in Tomorrowland (yes, that would be The Star Trader) underwent a renovation that incorporated a distinctly ‘Star Wars’ flair - including projections of Star Tours travelers visible in the space occupied by the now-defunct Peoplemover track. Thankfully, the exterior neon astronaut mickey sign stayed, but the former moog BGM loop did not. The renovation of The Star Trader introduced a new selection of themes from the first six Star Wars movies, mostly comprised of OST selections with a few deep cuts. The store officially reopened on May 6th, 2011.

I had recorded around 30 minutes of the loop on a previous trip, but recently Triple correctly identified the Walt Disney World Star Tours – The Adventures Continue attraction queue loop as being one and the same. We compared my 30-minute partial recording of the DL Star Trader loop with the WDW Star Tours queue loop and found them to be a perfect match (asides from some light playback timing differences). A huge thank you to Triple for sharing their recording so that this loop could be identified in full.

Nearly every track in the loop crossfades into the following track. Some of these tracks are not available commercially but can be found in user collections on Squidboard or Soulseek; I tried to note which ones but there’s a chance I missed some. Please shoot me a DM if you need help finding a track. The timing was a bit off on several tracks, but the timing was also slightly off between the WDW and DL loops so I didn’t specify any track speeds in my notes. My notated edit points are slightly off due to the numerous crossfades. My reconstruction can be found here:
