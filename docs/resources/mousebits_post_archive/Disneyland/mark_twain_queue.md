# Mark Twain Queue

*Posted by SSrustworthy on 7/3/2023*

Out of embarassment after not turning a shotgun mic on whilst standing in the Mark Twain queue and recording for 45 minutes, I neglected to write about how to get the Mark Twain queue music to play. So here is the rundown.

A kindly bearded cast member wanted to know why I was gazing all around the Frontier Landing covered queue area. I mentioned that I was intrigued by the fact that an orchestrion used to be situated here. He remembered it from the ‘old days’ and was kind enough to go and turn on the queue music, which features Jack Wagner’s recording of the original machine. The cast member had to run to the boathouse to turn something on, and then turned a key somewhere on the left side of the queue (if facing the river). The speakers are located on the ceiling.

I was able to grab like 2 minutes before I tried to attach the turned-off mic and botched the operation. Enjoy:
