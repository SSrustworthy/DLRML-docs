# Autopia Queue 2000 - 2017

*Posted by SSrustworthy on 09/02/2022; Updated 07/04/2024*

Note as of 7/4/24: I am overhauling this post for clarity and to fully delineate the entire loop based on some recently obtained recordings.

The Autopia Grandstand v.1 loop played in the grandstand queue area from the beginning of the Chevron sponsorship days continuing into the first year of sponsorship by Honda. The loop  changed over with the introduction of ASIMO and Bird as the central characters of the attraction, so it was roughly installed from June 29, 2000 until March 1, 2017. After the Chevron car dioramas were replaced with video screens of the short film “Magic Highway, U.S.A.”, which aired on *The Magical World of Disney* on May 14, 1958, the music was clearly audible in the dark portion of the queue.

The loop entirely consists entirely of on-board background music previously played on the east and west coast Peoplemover attractions. Given the public disappointment around the replacement of the cherished attraction with the doomed Rocket Rods, presumably the queue loop helped to stir up some nostalgia for the attraction that once was at Disneyland, and perhaps never will be again.

The first mention of this loop I could find was on March 20, 2002 by Jason/Progressland of the Magic Music forums, who wrote “Unfortunately I don't have a complete list, but it consists of some PeopleMover music, the Monorail Song, and a song from "Magic Highways" (the 1950s film that played in the pre-show area of the Rocket Rods queue).” (see Re: [**Disneyland Music Loops**](https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/disneyland-music-loops.17/post-203)).

The tracklist is as follows. Given that there are many versions of these tracks, I did not make note of edit points or speed.
