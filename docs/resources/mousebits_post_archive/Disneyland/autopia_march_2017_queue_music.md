# UPDATED TRACKLIST

I have updated the queue loop with edit points and a loop length based on videos from “Walking with the Mouse” on YouTube. Note that the track versions previously noted for Gadget Lover and Hot Pan have changed slightly.

# ORIGINAL POST

I bet you thought that the Autopia (presented by HONDA) queue music introduced with Bird and Asimo [in March 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPzkQ_Id2i8) was specially commissioned as a bunch of mindless pop... Well, you were wrong. I mean, it is mindless pop, but it's mostly production music licensed from Audio Network.

So here is the track list that you so desperately did not want, but also didn't expect:

## **Autopia Queue (3/24/2017 — present)**

1. Bang On - David Krajic - Synth Electro Pop

2. One Minute to Win it - Henry Jackman - Wreck-it Ralph OST

3. Gadget Lover 3 1869/15 - Science, Tech & Gadgets ANW 1869

4. Hot Pan 4 (60) 1655/47 - Quirky Kids ANW 1655

5. Fashion Statement 1901/8 - 8-Bit Electro ANW 1901

6. Vision 2130/6 - Quirky Electronica ANW 2130

7. Nano Hugs 1594/2 - Lifestyle Electronica ANW 1594

8. Social Media 2586/2 - Technology ANW 2586

9. Gadget Culture 1653/6 - Lifestyle, Corporate ANW 1653

10. 8 Bit Repeat - Rupert V.K. Pope - Electro House Beats

11. Get You Back - HeartThrob Beats - High Life: Electronic Pop

*All Audio Network tracks are denoted with the ANW album number. Other tracks (besides Wreck-it Ralph) are available on various streaming platforms. I didn't check Amazon.*

## A few notes on compiling the loop:

I went through about ten videos from Walking With The Mouse (great YouTube channel - many of the videos include the wait time in the queue, so you can hear larger loop snippets!). The "Bird" character breaks into a long-winded safety spiel for a whole 1.5 minutes pretty consistently, during which time the music is turned way down and is inaudible in these recordings. As a result, it's difficult to hear where one song starts and another ends. By matching up the overlapping listings from different videos, I was able to identify all songs in the loop.

An induction would be possible if you want to hold up the line. The covered section where the really-slow-moving videos of Asimo/Bird loading up the car, visiting places on a map, etc. plays the queue music really loudly by the videos without any dialogue. But this loop isn't that great, so I doubt anyone's going to do that for the sake of edit points.

Happy synth-electro-pop listening, my friends.
