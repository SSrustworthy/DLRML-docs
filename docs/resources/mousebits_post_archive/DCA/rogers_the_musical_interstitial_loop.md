# Rogers: The Musical interstitial loop

*Posted by SSrustworthy on 8/17/24*

This is a verified, incomplete tracklist for the interstitial loop from Rogers: The Musical. Using monorail91’s tracklist and several YouTube livestreams from the show, I was able to compile a patched reference recording that spans 41:30 minutes of music. The music is mostly needledrop with a cumulative minute of custom jingles themed as advertisements for Trolley Treats and Elias and Co. on Buena Vista Street that always play at the same point in the loop. The 5 and 10-minute show announcements are not part of the loop and are played separately while the loop volume is lowered or silenced.

The loop starts up at “It’s Been a Long, Long Time” at the end of every performance. This is verified by a recording I found featuring the first three tracks, and knowing from monorail91’s post that the King Porter Stomp and Bumble Bee Stomp play one after the other before the show starts.

The loop is turned off whenever a performance is starting to play a final show announcement from the KBVS radio announcer, which begins with the track “Stop The Search” by David Tobin, Jeff Meeghan, et al. from the album “Vintage Vocal Swing”. The playing of this announcement can occur at any point in the loop.

I was only able to find music leading up to the track “Moonlight Serenade” and did not identify a loop point asides from the loop restarting after each performance. You’d probably have had to spend more time than usual in the theater between shows, or do an unnoticed drop-off recording.

Due to the various releases of these tracks, I did not compile edit points, but I have made a reference recording available. I patched together three YouTube videos to comprise an incomplete reference recording. I used several more but this is adequate for creating a reconstruction:

I’ve also created my own reconstruction here, sans the advertising jingles:
