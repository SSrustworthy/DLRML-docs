# Coca Cola Ice Cold Refreshment Drive-In Gorilla

*Posted by SSrustworthy on 11/10/2024*

A nice little throwback - CThaddeus has some old home video that seems to have captured a decent portion of the gorilla stealing Coca Cola beverages in the "Coca Cola Ice Cold Refreshment" drive-in from DCA's early days. I've transcribed what I could below. The track "Too Much Monkey Business" by Chuck Berry is used as the song that the "radio station" is playing when not interrupted by the announcer with breaking news.

Check out some photos of the gorilla courtesy of Don's Disney Fans site:

# Transcript

(Partial) And, uh, that’s eye-witness report, uh, was reported just moments ago, at the flying saucer landing site! This is Thurston Wells. Stay tuned to this station for further developments, as they develop.

<interruption>

We interrupt this regularly scheduled broadcast for a news flash! This is Thurston Wells, your on-the-spot reporter. Flying saucer-like spaceships have landed on earth. I repeat, flying saucer-like spaceships have landed on earth! Details are sketchy, so stay tuned to this station as we will continue to report further developments as they happen!

<Interruption>

We interrupt our music program with more news! Thurston Wells again, at the invasion scene in Hollywood. Earlier today, flying saucers landed! And there are reports that a large, ape-like creature emerged from one of the silvery ships. According to one eye witness, the alien ape lumbered into a grocery store and loaded up his giant, hairy arms with bottles of ice cold refreshment! I will return with more news as it happens.

Ladies and gentlemen, Thurston Wells again with the latest development from the flying saucer landing site! This radio station has received *another* confirmed report that the ape man is on a refreshment rampage throughout the city, only targeting the most ice cold beverage, Coca Cola! Stay tuned.

> DCA used to have a radio-type loop outside Hollywood & Dine, which was pretty much identical to the Sci-Fi Dine In Loop from WDW's Studios.

Are you meaning the "sci-fi" themed audio that was played by the little Coke diner?  That actually had audio specifically related to the Space Gorilla that was originally at the little diner (and the posters and film shoot related materials on the "backside" of the diner).  I don't think it actually was the same audio from the Sci-Fi Diner in WDW...

DCA used to have a nice sci-fi loop, outside the Hollywood & Dine area, that came from a radio in DCA's Coke Corner, right next to the gorilla astronaut in the Chevy with Coke in the back. I thought that'd be a fun loop to have, but it's long gone by now.

No joke, the night before DL's 50th, when all the guests were put in DCA to spend the early morning, all the park's area music was shut off and replaced with a softer Disney-generic loop, except for the gorilla loop, which kept going loud as ever.
