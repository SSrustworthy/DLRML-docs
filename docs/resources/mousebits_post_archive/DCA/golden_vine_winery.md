# Golden Vine Winery

FYI, the "Sunday Sailing" - Liquid Amber track in the Golden Vine Winery v.2 loop has also been released as "Traveling West" - The Clair Marlo Project, Alexander Ace Baker - Vacation Scenes. It might be missing a few piano notes at the end, less than 5 seconds worth.

A further update on the Golden Vine Winery loops -

I did some snooping around on early DCA home videos, and found two 2001 videos with live bits of the loop that pixelated originally noted as an updated version:

- [Concache](https://youtu.be/UjO75fQvMcw?feature=shared&t=4176) in the Wine Country Market
- [Acoustic Planet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfKfpfH94r8) in the outdoor vineyard

Therefore, it seems that the Golden Vine Winery district had two loops since opening day, with one playing around the Golden Vine Winery (still played to this day) and the other likely used in The Vineyard Room and bathrooms. The 'Vineyard Room' loop was still playing in June 2012 in the Alfresco Lounge, upstairs and downstairs restrooms (MouseBits, [DCA Golden Vine Winery loop v.1 returns?](https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=6855.msg57321#msg57321)). Now that the Magic Key Terrace occupies that area, the upstairs restrooms play the new Magic Key Terrace loop.

Historically, the former loop has been labeled as v.2 or ca. 2008 as 1) it was not recorded on Progressland's original rundown of 2002 DCA tracklists sourced from the Town Hall binders or Kirsten's Disney Music Loops site (only the Vineyard Room loop was), and 2) pixelated only started his in-depth surveillance of loops around 2007/2008. So this discrepancy flew under the radar.

It's great to know that this is one of the last-standing original 2001 loops, along with Rushin' River Outfitters and lightly altered versions of the Off the Page and the Redwood Creek Challenge Trail.
