# Off the Page

*Posted by SSrustworthy on 8/7/24*

Off the Page in Hollywood Land is an opening day original. The shop offers special Disney collectables — including animation cells, figurines and art books.

X-S Tech originally noted the following about the loop over on the Magic Music Forums in May 2004:

> I'll be sending this to fxkristen's site also but in case anyone here keeps track, this is the playlist for the store Off the Page at the exit of the Animation attraction at DCA. This music is totally independent of the audio that plays in the Rotunda of the attraction next door, though at times the attraction audio is so loud that you can't hear the store's loop. Anyway all of this stuff is directly from the soundtracks but a few of the pieces have been editedin this loop. Sorry I don't have track times or anything.

I went in to record the current loop in May of 2024, and compiled the following tracklist. All source tracks been full compared with the reference recording.  In the years since the tracklist was noted in 2004, it appears to have altered slightly. “Following the Leader” (Peter Pan) was replaced by “How Far I’ll Go” (Moana) at some point after 2016, presumably to remove the racist lyrics. The surrounding section of tracks also changed position. Topsy Turvy may have also been added. The tracks are largely limited to their vocal portions, such that intro or outro instrumental portions on their OST releases are trimmed. There are otherwise no intra-track edits. Some tracks have a slight fade in or out to transition to the next track early.

Given the number of different releases of these tracks, I chose not to note edit points, but I am happy to share my reference recording for correctness:

All track lengths are measured from the start of the track until the next track begins.
