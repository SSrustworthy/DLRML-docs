# Rushin’ River Outfitters

*Posted by Aubrey on 6/14/24*

If you thought that all of the original DCA loops were long gone with the retheming of Pacific Wharf, think again. Rushin’ River Outfitters is still playing the glorious Sounds of Wood and Steel, and remains well-stocked with old cabin and 80’s xtreme sports kitsch.

I sat down on a (rare for a park shop) little wooden bench and recorded these sounds for you to enjoy from the comfort of your home!

Many of the tracks have long fadeouts (or rather, the ringing out of the last note played) and the next track starts while the previous one is still ending.
