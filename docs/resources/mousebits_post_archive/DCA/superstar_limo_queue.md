# Superstar Limo Queue

*Posted by SSrustworthy on 08/28/2022*

Hey all,

For anyone who is sad that the original upload disappeared, the WTTM podcast did post it as a "Bonussode" during the early part of the pandemic:

[https://pbarrie.libsyn.com/podcast/wttm-cvs-ss48-cheesy-awesome-the-superstar-limo-background-music-loop](https://pbarrie.libsyn.com/podcast/wttm-cvs-ss48-cheesy-awesome-the-superstar-limo-background-music-loop)

One would need to trim of the intro and outro of the podcast to isolate the loop. 

The complete track listing for Superstar Limo was posted online some time ago by SoCalRyan of Library Music Themes with some corrections and all missing tracks identified. For convenience, I've posted it here along with some additional formatting and track times as calculated from Djali999's original notes.

Most of these tracks were available on the OGM 80’s-90’s CD line (see notes below). Contrary to claims by Mike Cozart, none of the Peoplemover tracks are sped up for a ‘zany effect’, although there do seem to be some slight speed differences on tracks that were not released on the OGM CD line. See Magic Music, Re: [buddy baker/monorail theme fan](https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/buddy-baker-monorail-theme-fan.1774/#post-12120) (2004).
