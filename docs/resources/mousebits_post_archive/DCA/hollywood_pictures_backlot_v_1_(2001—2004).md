# Hollywood Pictures Backlot v.1 (2001—2004)

*Posted by SSrustworthy on 9/21/24*

This loop played along Hollywood Boulevard of Hollywood Pictures Backlot from the park’s 2001 opening until June 2004 ([source](https://disneymusicloops.tripod.com/dlr/dlr-hpb-hpb.html)). The track list was first posted separately on Kirsten Wahlquist’s [Disney Music Loops site](https://disneymusicloops.tripod.com/dlr/dlr-hpb-hpb.html) and by user tongoroa on the [Magic Music forums](https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/disneyland-music-loops.17/post-219). A [more complete track list](https://forums.mousebits.com/threads/hollywood-pictures-backlot-1-0.7108/) was created in 2012 by wedroy1923 and thx99, with some [additional discussion preceding it](https://forums.mousebits.com/threads/hollywood-pictures-backlot-loop.5991/) in 2010.

Given the unknown in this loop, I wanted to go and compile as many live clips of this loop as I could possibly could. This post builds upon the 2012 track list with the following updates:

- Identified two additional tracks, the “Felicity” theme song (previously unknown number 6) and “Titans Sprit” from “Remember the Titans” (omitted in the 2012 listing, but filling a gap in both of the Magic Music/Disney Music Loops listings prior to the “That’s Entertainment! Overture”
- Verified track versions and ordering (where possible) for all tracks except “Hooray for Hollywood”
- Determined edits when possible.
- Created a reference compilation of live clips.

A huge thank you to CThaddeus for sharing his home video samples with me, and to all of the users of the internet that wanted to share their precious DCA memories on home video with the rest of the world.

Also, although I did not find any trace of “Hooray for Hollywood” among the clips, Timekeeper [noted the following](https://forums.mousebits.com/threads/disneyland-resort-music-compendium.8517/post-80130) about the “Hooray for Hollywood” track:

> On the first Hollywood Pictures Backlot loop, a note for the first track, "Hooray for Hollywood", it should be edited from 1:21 until end (to remove orchestra tuning, conductor and director line and various audio bits, as the track starts from the chorus line) and that the source is found from the Walt Disney World Forever Project.

# Live clips

I created a folder of clips, but consolidated into “clip blocks” for which transition points were available. As an example, I had a transition point for the thirtysomething theme → Felicity theme, but not for Felicity → Axel F, so Axel F is at the beginning of a different clip block. The clips have gaps in them as they were lined up side-by-side with their source tracks in a DAW.

I will note that given the “early” track lists in conjunction with the live clips, I think my track list contains all of the correct tracks with no gaps, although tracks may be missing edit points and transition points.
