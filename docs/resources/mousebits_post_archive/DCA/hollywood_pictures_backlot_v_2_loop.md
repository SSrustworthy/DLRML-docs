# Hollywood Pictures Backlot v.2 loop

*Not posted*

Using 4 different recordings featuring pages, it appears that the full loop is indeed 2 repetitions of the background music with 2 different sets of pages announced by the Hollywood Pictures Operator (HPO). However, the pages can appear in different places across those two sub-loops of the music (for example, a HPO page appears after The Big Olive in one of the sub-loops, but not in the other).

As pixelated noted earlier, the loop length is 1:54:20.780 until all of the pages repeat. This perfectly encapsulates two full repetitions of the BGM.

For a time in 2012 prior to the installation of the Hollywood Land BGM, the music loop played in full sans HPO pages.

The below track list specifies edit points for the tracks identified by wedroy1923 and as listed on [Kirsten’s Disney Music Loops site](https://disneymusicloops.tripod.com/dlr/dlr-hpb-hpb2.html).

This loop was installed around June or July of 2004 (Kirsten’s site lists June 2004, whereas the Magic Music post is dated to July), and the pages were removed by April of 2012. The new Big Band loop was introduced in [mid-May of 2012](https://forums.mousebits.com/threads/new-hollywood-land-bgm.7298/).

# Transcript of Hollywood Pictures Operator Pages

Note: Each page starts with a short 5-note chime to the tune of “Zip-a-dee-doo-dah” (one note for each syllable). The pages are then announced by Daisy Duck, who at one point identifies herself as the HPO. Interestingly, Kirsten’s site lists that there was a page for “Bear” (possibly Bear in the Big Blue House, who was featured in Playhouse Disney - Live on Stage!) and a 2004 [Magic Music post](https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/new-loop-at-dcas-hollywood-pictures-backlot.1574/#post-10552) suggests that there was a Beast page which basically replaced the Hunchback pagebelow with the Beast’s name (for whom Belle is also relevant). Both Kirsten’s site and the Magic Music forums posts were from 2004, whereas the earliest full reference recording we have is from 2010.
