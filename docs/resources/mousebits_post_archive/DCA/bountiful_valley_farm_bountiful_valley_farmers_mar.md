# Bountiful Valley Farm / Bountiful Valley Farmers Market

*Posted by SSrustworthy on 08/31/2024*

The Bountiful Valley Farm / Bountiful Valley Farmers Market loop played throughout the Bountiful Valley Farm district, particularly near the Caterpillar and agricultural displays and the Sam Andreas Shakes and Bountiful Valley Farmers Market quick-service locations. After the opening of “a bug’s land”, it could only be heard near the Bountiful Valley Farmers Market until it went quiet by 2007/2008. The last traces of the Bountiful Valley Farm district disappeared in 2010 with the construction of Cars Land.

Early DCA 2001 footage shows brief segments of the loop: [Footprints In The Snow](https://youtu.be/wJwPtCri5NU?feature=shared&t=1499) near Sam Andreas Shakes, [The Talking](https://youtu.be/hfKfpfH94r8?feature=shared&t=18) in the agricultural display area, and a [transition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=shared&t=1543&v=wJwPtCri5NU) between Land ‘Turkey in The Straw’ and Fiddler’s Dram / Whiskey Before Breakfast between the Farmers Expo building and agricultural display area.

While we still do not have a full reference recording for this loop, there is a demo version of the loop (i.e., low-quality stereo tracks passed around WDI for approval) in limited circulation. It also aligns with what is likely the Town Hall printed tracklist that was available at the time - see Magic Music user Progressland’s post [Disneyland Music Loops](https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/disneyland-music-loops.17/post-146) (Magic Music, 2002), and [Farmer's Market Area Music](https://disneymusicloops.tripod.com/dlr/dlr-abl-fm.html) (Kirsten's Disney Music Loops site). Note, the Green Acres Theme is not listed on the Magic Music forums, even as it appears on the demo and DML tracklist. The demo version has the same track versions as listed on Kirsten’s Disney Music Loops site, but they are spaced out quite a bit compared to the brief live transition from the 2001 home video.

Most important to note about this loop is that there are still two unknown tracks. Thanks to this demo version, we now have access to them for future IDing efforts - but so far those efforts (including reddit posts, YouTube identification, soulseek, discogs, and music apps) have turned up empty.

Below is a version of the original Disney Music Loops site tracklist, lightly edited for accuracy. Track times were removed as it is unclear whether the track times were based on the circulating demo version (with inaccurate track spacings), the actual source tracks as released, or someone's own reference recording.
