## Tracklist

1\. When You Wish Upon A Star – Tokyo Disneyland – 15th Anniversary Music 4: Grand Finale

- Loop Track Length: 1:43
- Track Notes: Same as the previous version of the loop. While this track can be found on a number of albums, as before I’m listing it as from the Tokyo Disneyland 15th Anniversary Music 5: Grand Finale CD as this CD contains a number of tracks from this loop.

2\. You've Got A Friend In Me – Cincinnati Pops Orchestra – Magical Musicals 

- Loop Track Length: 3:20
- Track Notes: Same as the previous version of the loop.

3\. McQueen and Sally – Randy Newman – Cars OST 

- Loop Track Length: 1:48
- Track Notes: The album version of this track runs 1:59, the loop version ends with a quick fadeout starting at approximately 1:47 into the album track.

4\. Touring the Kingdom/Part of Your World – The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Undersea Adventure Queue BGM 

- Loop Track Length: 2:32
- Track Notes: This is from the Queue BGM of The Little Mermaid: Ariel’s Undersea Adventure. The loop track actually starts at the very end of the loop (20:19.6 into the loop), just before the loop point. If you try to line up the Little Mermaid track from the 2013 Official Album, you’ll notice the start of that track (which is the start of the Queue loop) lines up with approximately 4.5 seconds into the loop track. The queue loop itself (which runs 20:24) does exist as source, but is not in general circulation. The loop track ends with a quick crossfade into You Can Fly! to hide a fast transition into Under the Sea, which is the next track in the Mermaid Queue BGM.

5\. You Can Fly! You Can Fly! You Can Fly! – Peter Pan's Flight Queue BGM 

- Loop Track Length: 1:24
- Track Notes: While YCF! appeared in previous versions of the Esplanade loop, this track comes directly from the attraction’s Queue BGM instead of being a cover. The loop version begins with 4 seconds of string tremolo that isn’t present in the Queue BGM; you can hear this same tremolo at 4:51 and 5:40 and 6:45 in the “Fantasyland Darkride Suite” included on Disneyland Resort official albums since 2005.

6\. Indiana Jones Theme

- Loop Track Length: 2:09
- Track Notes: Same as the previous version of the loop.

7\. Casey Junior – Never Land Orchestra – Disney's Orchestra Collection Vol. 3 

- Loop Track Length: 2:42
- Track Notes: The album track, which runs 2:57, features a long fade out; the loop version fades out much faster to bring the running time down to 2:42.

8\. Hi Diddle Dee Dee –  

- Loop Track Length: 1:12
- Track Notes: Same as the previous version of the loop, but shorter, with an abrupt fade out at 1:12. In the prior version of the loop this track ran 1:20 and crossfaded directly into Under the Sea.

9\. First Day – Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage Queue BGM 

- Loop Track Length: 4:26
- Track Notes: This track is an arrangement of “First Day” (see: Finding Nemo OST) from the Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage Queue BGM (aka The Seas with Nemo and Friends Area BGM). In the recording of the Seas with Nemo and Friends area BGM posted here on MouseBits, the track used in the Esplanade loop begins at 33:00. The full Nemo loop features crossfades at both the beginning and end of the track.

10\. The Tiki Tiki Tiki Room – Tokyo Disneyland 15th Anniversary Music 4: Grand Finale 

- Loop Track Length: 1:39
- Track Notes: Same as the previous version of the loop.

11\. Pirates of the Caribbean Medley –  

- Loop Track Length: 2:01
- Track Notes: A really interesting arrangement that flips back and forth between Yo Ho, A Pirates Life For Me from the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction and the He’s A Pirate theme from the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, with guitar, percussion, flute, accordion, and strings. My guess would be that this was an arrangement done for Shanghai Disneyland, but I haven’t been able to confirm that. This track is also part of the Caribbean Plaza area BGM used at WDW's Magic Kingdom since the ride was updated to include Jack Sparrow; that loop runs 56:25 and the track in question plays between "You Look Good Jack" from Dead Man's Chest and "Up is Down" from At World's End.
Crossfade into next track

12\. Hooray For Hollywood – The Boston Pops Orchestra – Salute to Hollywood 

- Loop Track Length: 3:23
- Track Notes: Same as the previous version of the loop.

13\. Fortuosity – Main Street USA BGM 2012 

- Loop Track Length: 1:41
- Track Notes: From the Main Street USA Area BGM, arranged and recorded by Dean Mora, which began playing at Disneyland in 2012.

14\. Welcome to Tomorrowland – Disneyland Resort Official Album 2006: Remember the Moments

- Loop Track Length: 3:33
- Track Notes: This track was one of a collection of tracks created by Dan Foliart for the Tomorrowland BGMs that have been used at various Disney parks since, with each park getting a unique selection of tracks. This track is featured in the Tokyo Disneyland Tomorrowland BGM but is NOT included in the Disneyland or Magic Kingdom versions of the loop; nevertheless it was included on the 2006 Official Albums for both Disneyland (“Remember the Moments”) and Walt DIsney World (“Where Magic Lives”); it’s inclusion in the Esplanade loop marks the first time its played at Disneyland. The album version is 4:10, the loop version cuts approximately 8 seconds from the start of the track before starting with a slow fade in, then fades out at the end, ending 30 seconds before the end of the album track.

15\. Heigh Ho –  

- Loop Track Length: 2:06
- Track Notes: Same as previous version of the loop, however in the prior loop this track ran about a second and a half longer with a crossfade directly into Smile Darn Ya Smile. Here the track quickly fades out during the tremolo.

16\. March of the Cards – Alice in Wonderland Queue BGM – Disneyland Forever 

- Loop Track Length: 2:04
- Track Notes: This is a different arrangement of March of the Cards than appeared in the previous version of the loop. This version, from the Alice in Wonderland Queue BGM, appeared on Disneyland Forever with a running time of 2:21. The loop version starts 3 seconds into the album version, and is edited starting 2:03 into the album version to splice in a new ending (running about 3 seconds) which doesn’t seem to appear in any of the Alice in Wonderland Queue BGM tracks I’ve been able to find (the Disneyland Forever version ends with a long fade out).

17\. Touch the Sky – Fantasy Faire BGM   Disneyland Resort Official Album 2013 

- Loop Track Length: 2:28
- Track Notes: This track, from the Area BGM for Disneyland’s Fantasy Faire area, was arranged by Michael Tavera, and appears on the 2013 Disneyland Official Album.

18\. Baroque Hoedown – Main Street Electrical Parade 2010 

- Loop Track Length: 1:20
- Track Notes: This is one full loop of the lead float loop from the current version of the Main Street Electrical Parade, which has been in use since 2010. This version of the music was originally arranged for Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade Dreamlights by Greg Smith. The arrangement here differs very slightly however from the version featured in Dreamlights (most mixes include character voices and SFX, so you’d specifically want the Tokyo Disneyland Electrical Parade Dreamlights: Show Mix Edition CD, which includes a “Music Piece Edition” without character voices or SFX), and the TDL mix also includes crossfades in and out of the loop. There is a rehearsal CD for the 2010 DCA version of the parade in circulation, but that includes the Tinker Bell pixie dust SFX at several points during the float loop, which isn’t present in the Esplanade loop. You could use an induction of the parade underliner to recreate this track, or you could probably get very very close by editing together the TDL and rehearsal CD tracks.

19\. It's a Small World – Walt Disney and the 1964 World's Fair 

- Loop Track Length: 0:49
- Track Notes: This instrumental of the theme song from It’s A Small World can be found on the Walt Disney and the 1964 World’s Fair box set at the very beginning of track “The Ultimate MegaMix”.

20\. Mickey Mouse Club March –  

- Loop Track Length: 1:58
- Track Notes: This is the same track as the previous version of the loop, but a longer edit. The previous loop’s track started 6 seconds into this track, and ended with a crossfade into Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah; this version simply fades out.

21\. Frozen Medley (Curtain Call) – Frozen: Live at the Hyperion 

- Loop Track Length: 2:22
- Track Notes: This is the instrumental of the Curtain Call/finale from Frozen: Live at the Hyperion. Disney has yet to release a soundtrack for the show, however even if they do the show features a group chorus during the “Love is an Open Door” segment of the track; an instrumental from the rehearsal CD should be an exact match, but it has yet to circulate.

22\. Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah – Tokyo Disneyland 15th Anniversary Music 4: Grand Finale 

- Loop Track Length: 2:31
- Track Notes: This version of Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah from Disneyland’s Splash Mountain Area BGM (sometimes also called the Critter Country BGM) was included on Disneyland Forever and also appears on Tokyo Disneyland 15th Anniversary Music 4: Grand Finale. The album version has a runtime of 3:57; the loop version is edited to exclude 1:03-2:30 of the album track. The edit is easy to recreate although poorly done- as edited, the track literally skips a beat, cutting the last beat of the measure before the edit point.

23\. Mickey Mouse Club March / Ballad Of Davy Crockett – Oh Mickey, Where Art Thou OR Disney Adventures in Bluegrass

- Loop Track Length: 1:14
- Track Notes: Appears in full in the Frontierland 2012 BGM loop; a bluegrass medley of Mickey Mouse March and The Ballad of Davy Crockett, here the track is edited (starting 1:30 into the album track) to only include the Davy Crocket portion.

24\. Be Our Guest – King Arthur Carousel BGM 2005 

- Loop Track Length: 2:05
- Track Notes: This version of Be Our Guest is an arrangement from the current Fantasyland Band Organ/King Arthur Carousel loop, which was arranged by Michael Tavera and replaced the original Fantasyland Band Organ loop circa 2005. No copies or recordings of the full loop are in circulation. Notably this is a different track than appeared in the previous version of the loop, which was from Cinderella’s Golden Carousel (now called Prince Charming Regal Carrousel [sic]) at Walt Disney World.

25\. Fantasmic! Exit Music – Fantasmic! 

- Loop Track Length: 2:53
- Track Notes: Same as the previous version of the loop. The loop version cuts about 2.5 seconds off the opening fade in in order to fade in faster. As I’ve noted before, while all releases of Fantastic! include the exit music, only the original Walt Disney World CD release features it as it’s own separate track, with a running time of 3:02; some non-theme park compilations have also included it, such as A Musical Tour: Treasure of the Walt Disney Archivist the Reagan Library (available on iTunes), which has a running time of 2:58.

26\. Soarin' Over California – Disneyland Resort Official Album 2013 

- Loop Track Length: 4:33
- Track Notes: The previous version of the loop featured the Soarin’ Over California Load/Unload music; this version replaces it with the actual score from the ride. A slightly curious choice since that version of the film hasn’t played at Disneyland since June 2016, having been replaced with the new Soarin’ Around The World film and a new score by Bruce Broughton. The loop version begins 6 seconds into the album version with a fade in.

27\. California Blues – Mora's Modern Rhythmists – Devil's Serenade 

- Loop Track Length: 3:08
- Track Notes: This track is from the Buena Vista Street BGM.

28\. Main Title / Rebel Blockade Runner – Star Wars OST 

- Loop Track Length: 1:22
- Track Notes: This is the title music from the original Star Wars (aka A New Hope) soundtrack, edited from an album length of 5:25 (using the most recent soundtrack release on iTunes) to fade out at 1:22, with a crossfade into the next track.

29\. The Scare Floor – Monsters Inc: Mike and Sulley to the Rescue Queue BGM 

- Loop Track Length: 2:48
- Track Notes: This track comes from the Monsters Inc: Mike and Sulley to the Rescue Queue BGM (the same loop also plays at Monsters Inc Laugh Floor at Walt Disney World). That loop, which runs 30:11 includes both tracks from the Monsters Inc OST and new arrangements, this track is one of the new arrangements, appearing in that loop in between edits “School” and “Randall Appears,” both from the OST. The Queue BGM track runs 5:11; the Esplanade loop version is edited to exclude 1:06-3:29 of the original track.

30\. Strange Things – Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters 

- Loop Track Length: 1:05
- Track Notes: This loop from the Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters score plays in the Planet Zurg scene. Though the loop is included as part of the medley featured on Disneyland official albums since 2005, that medley includes lots of sound effects playing over it as well as crossfades in and out; you would need the source loops in order to reconstruct this track.

31\. Steamboat Willie – Disneyland Resort Official Album   2013 

- Loop Track Length: 0:52
- Track Notes: This track is from the Mickey’s Toontown BGM loop; it was included in Disneyland Forever and has appeared on a number of official albums including the most recent one, with a running time of 2:08. The loop version starts 1:17 into the album track. Annoyingly there is one small difference between the loop version and the album version- the loop version features a two part ratchet sound effects; the album version only includes the second part of this sound effect. It’s an odd difference, and all the album versions of the track I’ve checked have been identical.

32\. All In The Golden Afternoon – Tokyo Disneyland 15 Anniversary Music 4: Grand Finale 

- Loop Track Length: 2:56
- Track Notes: Same as the previous version of the loop.

33\. The Time of Your Life – A Bug's Land BGM 

- Loop Track Length: 3:19
- Track Notes: This track is from the A Bug’s Land Area BGM, which features new arrangements of tracks from the A Bug’s Life score and runs 23:43.

34\. Winnie the Pooh Theme – Winnie the Pooh Queue BGM 

- Loop Track Length: 1:20
- Track Notes: Part of this track, from The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh Queue BGM, is included in the medley track featured on several official albums, but that only includes the first 31 seconds of the full track.

35\. Hip Hip Pooh-Ray! – Winnie the Pooh Queue BGM 

- Loop Track Length: 0:48
- Track Notes: Tempting though it might be to consider this one track along with Track 32, since they are both from the same loop (The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh Queue BGM) they are two separate tracks and are separated by 9 and a half minutes in the Queue loop, which runs a total of 21:15.

36\. Surrey with the Fringe on Top – Main Street USA BGM 2012 

- Loop Track Length: 1:48
- Track Notes: From the Main Street USA Area BGM, arranged and recorded by Dean Mora, which began playing at Disneyland in 2012.
