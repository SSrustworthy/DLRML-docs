## Description

**Area**: Esplanade-Main Gates

**Loop Total Length**: 00:31:58

**Dates**: November 1, 2005

**Holiday/Special Event**: Christmas

Plays in the esplanade during the holiday season. First heard in 2005 ([https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/dl-christmas-esplenade-loop.2674/#post-17246](https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/dl-christmas-esplenade-loop.2674/#post-17246)), and heard nearly every season since. This loop did not play in 2012 (that year, the non-holiday loop played) or 2018 (see loop v.2). Tracks in the loop sometimes play over the ending of the previous track, and thus the exact times of the tracks as heard in the loop may be slightly different.
