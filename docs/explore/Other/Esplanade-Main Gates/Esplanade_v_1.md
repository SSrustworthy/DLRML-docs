This loop played in the Esplanade from 2001 to 2004. Most of these tracks likely have the same sources as Esplanade v.2, but I have yet to find a detailed source list. Additional information is available on MouseBits, see [https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/disneyland-esplanade-playlist-questions.56/#post-381](https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/disneyland-esplanade-playlist-questions.56/#post-381) (2002).
