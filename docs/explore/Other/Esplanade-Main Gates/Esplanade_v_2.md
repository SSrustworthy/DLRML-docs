This is an instrumental version that played after the film was over while guests were exiting the theater. A copy of the full show audio has circulated, though it features "Califia" (aka Whoopie Goldberg) talking over parts of it. She does, however, only talk in one channel (left/right) at a time, so it's possible to edit her out.
