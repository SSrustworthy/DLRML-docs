## Description

**Area**: Downtown Disney

**Loop Total Length**: 01:44:00.8

**Dates**: October 22, 2018

This is the same loop as the Disney Springs Marketplace. See Magic Music, [https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/disney-springs-area-music.5095/post-35731](https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/disney-springs-area-music.5095/post-35731) (2015). There are crossfades or overlaps between tracks, and the loop doesn't contain a single silent gap longer than a fraction of a second. This is a totally original loop of Disney songs arranged in a jazz-techno-fusion style. The loop was composed by [https://michaeltavera.com/project/disney-springs-resort-2/.](https://michaeltavera.com/project/disney-springs-resort-2/.) An “augmented” version of this loop with additional needle drop songs such as “Right Now” by Mocean Worker was also used for the 8PM to 2AM nighttime loop in Downtown Disney.
