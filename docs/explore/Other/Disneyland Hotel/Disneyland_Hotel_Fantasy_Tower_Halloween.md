This loop plays around the Disneyland Hotel during the Halloween season, and is particularly audible in the Porte-Cochere. Tracklist compiled by pixelated based on his 2021 reference recording. pixelated also noted: “SoundHound says that Bach: Greatest Organ Favorites is the source album for the famous Toccata tracks & the Passacaglia tracks, while another album, Couleur/Toccata is the source album for the Prelude and Fugue tracks.  But that other album also has the other two compositions as well.  Both versions of those two compositions need to be compared against each other to see if they are identical between the two albums.”
