# Bountiful Valley Farm

## Description

**Land(s)**: Golden State

**District/Neighborhood**: Bountiful Valley Farm

**Loop Total Length**: Unknown

The Bountiful Valley Farm / Bountiful Valley Farmers Market loop played throughout the Bountiful Valley Farm district, particularly near the Caterpillar and agricultural displays and the Sam Andreas Shakes and Bountiful Valley Farmers Market quick-service locations. After the opening of “a bug’s land”, it could only be heard near the Bountiful Valley Farmers Market until it went quiet by 2007/2008. The last traces of the Bountiful Valley Farm district disappeared in 2010 with the construction of Cars Land.
