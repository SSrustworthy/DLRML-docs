# Grizzly River Run Queue v.1

## Description

**Land(s)**: Golden State

**District/Neighborhood**: Grizzly Peak Recreation Area

**Loop Total Length**: ~00:50:44?

**Dates**: February 8, 2001 → January 30, 2012

This loop has played from park opening until around January 30, 2012 when the attraction was closed for refurbishment and placemaking. It could be heard in the queue area of Grizzly River Run. The best place to hear it in the queue line was over the bridge by the displays with the kayaks on the roof. There was a desk with a radio playing the loop. It also played overhead the attraction exit staircase. It is composed like a radio station with announcements and callers featured between songs. A MouseBits torrent is available of live recording samples of the announcements.
