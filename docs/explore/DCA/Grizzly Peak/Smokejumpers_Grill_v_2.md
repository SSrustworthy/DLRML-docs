A preliminary track list for the second iteration of the Smokejumpers Grill restaurant interior loop compiled by pixelated based on a reference recording by StarWarsGalaxysEdge. It is unclear when it was replaced, but a change was first reported in August of 2023. Tracks were potentially replaced due to insensitive lyrical undertones. See MouseBits, [https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=8915.msg85184#msg85184](https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=8915.msg85184#msg85184) (2015).
