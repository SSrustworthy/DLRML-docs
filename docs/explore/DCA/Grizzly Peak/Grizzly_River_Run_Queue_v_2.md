This extended queue loop was installed sometime after the placemaking of Grizzly River Run from an Xtreme sports theme to a genteel national parks theme. Possible installation in 2011-2013. The loop is just music with no radio broadcast unlike v.1. Preliminary tracklist compiled by pixelated, RocketRodsXPR and wedroy1923.
