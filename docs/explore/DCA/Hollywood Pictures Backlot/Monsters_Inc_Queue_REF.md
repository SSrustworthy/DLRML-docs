This loop plays in the queue area for the attraction Monsters, Inc. Mike & Sulley to the Rescue!. See C33’s post on Magic Music, [https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/monsters-inc-queue-music-dca.3746/#post-26602](https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/monsters-inc-queue-music-dca.3746/#post-26602) (2008). The queue is likely the same as WDW’s [https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/monsters-inc-laugh-floor-queue-area-music.4921/post-34784.](https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/monsters-inc-laugh-floor-queue-area-music.4921/post-34784.)

## Tracklist

1. Monsters, Inc. – Randy Newman – Monsters, Inc. OST


2. Walk to Work – Randy Newman – Monsters, Inc. OST


3. If I Didn't Have You [Instrumental] – Riders in the Sky – Monsters, Inc. Scream Factory Favorites
- Track Notes: While the version of "If I Didn't Have You" on the CD is the same version that plays in the loop, the CD version has some witty banter between band members that does not appear in the loop version. The loop version simply cuts from the point right before that section to the point right after it with a deft cut that actually makes the track flow a little better than the original. What this means more importantly though is that, with the exception of the three non-needledrop (or otherwise unidentified at this point) tracks, it is possible to create an accurate reconstruction.

4. School – Randy Newman – Monsters, Inc. OST
- Track Notes: Starts at 0:58

5. Unknown unreleased track
- Loop Track Length: 5:12
- Track Notes: Track five follows the same melody as track 7, "The Scare Floor", but is it's own separate track, with a time of 5:12.

6. Randall Appears – Randy Newman – Monsters, Inc. OST


7. The Scare Floor – Randy Newman – Monsters, Inc. OST


8. Oh Celia! – Randy Newman – Monsters, Inc. OST


9. Unknown unreleased track
- Track Notes: While a cursory listen to the loop and track 8, "Oh Celia!", makes it seem like they're the same, they're not- in fact "O Celia!" gets remixed and expanded into tracks 8 and 9, sort of an "Extended Mix" if you will. While parts of this mix clearly come from the needledrop track the track does not "fit in" anywhere in the loop version exactly, it comes close for a few seconds and then the timing changes. The rest of the track appears to be original to the loop.

10. Big High Wire Hop – Riders in the Sky – Monsters, Inc. Scream Factory Favorites
