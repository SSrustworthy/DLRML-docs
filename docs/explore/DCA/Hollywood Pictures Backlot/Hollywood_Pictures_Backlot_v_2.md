The second area loop to play in the Hollywood Pictures Backlot. Played from June/July 2004 until mid-May 2012 when HPB was renamed to Hollywood Land. The full loop had “pages” from an unseen Hollywood Pictures Operator interspersed every few tracks and consisted of two sub-repetitions of the musical loop, with 15 unique HPO pages before the full loop repeated. A short period of time in 2012 had the music loop audible sans interruptions from pages.
