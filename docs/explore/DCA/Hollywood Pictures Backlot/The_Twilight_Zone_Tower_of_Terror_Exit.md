This track plays from speakers hanging from the ceiling in the hallways leading from the unload to the gift shop. This is a custom, non-needledrop arrangement of music that seems to be floating around in source from various collectors. The track is called “Unload - Exit Hallway BGM.” See MouseBits, [https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=3574.msg23958#msg23958](https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=3574.msg23958#msg23958) (2008), [https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=2906.msg18685#msg18685](https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=2906.msg18685#msg18685) (2008), and [https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/c33-notes-3-31-09.4108/#post-29698](https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/c33-notes-3-31-09.4108/#post-29698) (2009).
