This loop played in Sunshine Plaza during the 2008 Christmas season (and possibly 2002-2007; 2010 as well). It was replaced by Santa’s Seaside Pavilion the following year. See MouseBits, [https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=3843.msg26195#msg26195.](https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=3843.msg26195#msg26195.) As of Thanksgiving weekend 2011, the alternate entrance walkway being used during Buena Vista Street construction was playing the same music as normal and not any Christmas music (MouseBits, [https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=6912.msg58031#msg58031](https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=6912.msg58031#msg58031))
