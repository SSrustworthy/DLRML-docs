# Sunshine Plaza Holiday v.1 [PRE]

## Description

**Land(s)**: Sunshine Plaza

**Loop Total Length**: Unknown

**Dates**: November 1, 2001 → January 1, 2002

**Holiday/Special Event**: Christmas

This loop played during DCA’s first Christmas in 2001. MouseBits member Jarvis says: “At the time, they just stuck four Christmas songs into the regular loop (edited in very badly, too, as I recall--you could hear the regular loop fading out and the Christmas song fading in). I think the four songs did up making the real Christmas loop, which started in 2002.” Tracks added based on labeled tracks in limited circulation.
