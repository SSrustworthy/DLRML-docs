This loop played during DCA’s first Christmas in 2001. MouseBits member Jarvis says: “At the time, they just stuck four Christmas songs into the regular loop (edited in very badly, too, as I recall--you could hear the regular loop fading out and the Christmas song fading in). I think the four songs did up making the real Christmas loop, which started in 2002.” See MouseBits, [https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=6912.msg58376#msg58376](https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=6912.msg58376#msg58376) (2011). It is unknown which songs these were and where they were in the loop.
