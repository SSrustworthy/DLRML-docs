- Track Notes: The album track is edited at 2:00 (right before the drum & cymbal/hi-hat hit) to omit the rest of the track. The resulting edit cuts from "California Swing" to the drum & trumpet hit at the start of the next loop track, "Shake That Thing", on the beat and it's hard to tell another track is playing.
