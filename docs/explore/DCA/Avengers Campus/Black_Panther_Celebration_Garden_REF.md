Tracklist compiled by pixelated based on his induction recording on Mousecord. The timecode values may be off because many of the source tracks start with fades and their use in the loop may overlap with the preceding track. That makes it harder to hear, and to see in the recording's spectrogram, when the track starts to play. The only edits are to ensure there are minimal silences between tracks. The loop's level drops but doesn't completely fade and is temporarily replaced by the United Nations/End Titles track for the arrival of Shuri at the garden.
