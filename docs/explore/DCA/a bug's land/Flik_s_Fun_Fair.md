# Flik's Fun Fair

## Description

**Land(s)**: "a bug's land"

**Loop Total Length**: 00:23:44.785

**Dates**: October 7, 2002 → September 4, 2018

This is a different loop than the "it's a bug's land" loop that is made up of reorchestrated themes from the score. It plays solely by the entrance to Flik's Fun Fair. The music is arguably more light-hearted and melodic than the "it's a bug's land" loop, and the loop does not contain insect noises. This loop was also discussed by C33 in the Re: bugland at dca topic. I have lined this up with the "A Bug's Life Suite" released on the OA's and found that it plays in full during this loop with no edits. This is a different orchestration than the one found on the movie OST.
