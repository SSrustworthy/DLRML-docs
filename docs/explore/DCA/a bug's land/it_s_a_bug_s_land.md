# "it's a bug's land"

## Description

**Land(s)**: "a bug's land"

**Loop Total Length**: 00:21:47

This is a loop of music edited directly from the movie soundtrack with some insect noises occasionally bridging together tracks. It played in the queue for It's Tough to Be a Bug! (ITTBAB) and across from the Blue Sky Cellar on the parade route. See MouseBits, [https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=10829.msg99069#msg99069](https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=10829.msg99069#msg99069) (2022) and Magic Music, [https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/a-bugs-land-area-music.5252/.](https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/a-bugs-land-area-music.5252/.) C33 says: “I'm not sure of the source of the recording, due to the quality and some noise artifacts it does not appear to be "source" audio, however it is in stereo which is unusual for induction recordings. It may, nevertheless, be a stereo induction recording. The loop is comprised of tracks from the official soundtrack, some of which are edited as noted. There are also bug sounds/noises interspersed with and on top of some of the tracks.”
