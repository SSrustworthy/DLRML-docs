# Flik's Flyers

## Description

**Land(s)**: "a bug's land"

**Loop Total Length**: 00:01:24.553

**Dates**: October 7, 2002 → September 4, 2018

The length of this loop (including sound effects and the music) is 00:01:24.553. The portion of the loop that is music-only is 00:01:21.625. I have lined this up with the soundtrack version of Flik's Machine and confirmed that the attraction plays most of the latter half of the track, starting from 00:01:25:685. The attraction version is only slightly edited, editing out a portion from ~2:40 to 2:44 of the album track.
