This is an attraction loop that plays onboard Jessie’s Critter Carousel. The tracks only play when the carousel is in motion, one track at a time. The order of the tracks is unknown. See Pixar Post, [https://pixarpost.com/2019/04/climb-aboard-jessies-critter-carousel.html](https://pixarpost.com/2019/04/climb-aboard-jessies-critter-carousel.html) (2019). The carousel features six rearranged musical tracks including the “Woody’s Roundup Theme” and several other songs from the show within a show from Toy Story 2. A brand new song, “Jessie Saves The Day” was written specifically for the attraction. Order checked via several YT videos.
