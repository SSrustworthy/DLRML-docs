In 1963, Disneyland used a reel of Martin Denny exotica/tropical music in the garden show area. All of the Martin Denny group’s bird calls on the tracks were left intact and. Although the exact date is unclear, the music was changed to a slower set of tracks (v.2), potentially in the early 70s. Martin Denny himself has claimed to have heard his track “Lotus Land” playing.
