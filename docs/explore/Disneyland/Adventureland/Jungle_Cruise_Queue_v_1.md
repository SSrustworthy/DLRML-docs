# Jungle Cruise Queue v.1

## Description

**Land(s)**: Adventureland

**Loop Total Length**: ~ 30:12

This Jack Wagner-compiled loop played in the original Jungle Cruise queue. Tracklist based on a source track in limited circulation. MightyTriton on Magic Music said “I also remember waiting in line under the grass thatched huts and there was a music loop in there. Music from African tribes played non stop. I remember trying to differentiate the songs from one another but they all sounded the same to me. The speakers were spread out and near the end of the switchbacks. The volume wasn't that loud unless you were directly under one of the speakers, so it did not interfere with all of the jungle sounds too much.” The Kenster said “There was the African Tribe music loop in the old Jungle Cruise queue. I couldn't tell one song from another.” See Magic Music, Re: [https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/jungle-cruise-queue-bgm.3691/page-2](https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/jungle-cruise-queue-bgm.3691/page-2) (2008) and [https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/disneyland-music-loops.17/page-3](https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/disneyland-music-loops.17/page-3) (2002). Replaced when the attraction was enhanced for the opening of Indiana Jones Adventure.
