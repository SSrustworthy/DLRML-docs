# Jingle Cruise Boathouse v.2 [INC]

## Description

**Land(s)**: Adventureland

**Loop Total Length**: Unknown

**Holiday/Special Event**: Christmas

Starting in 2014, a second version of the Jingle Cruise loop played with no announcements between tracks and the second “I want a Hippopotamus for Christmas” track was removed. Apparently, "Rudolf the Red Nosed Reindeer" by Arthur Lyman (the same one heard on the Trader Sam's Christmas loop) is also included in the loop. See MouseBits, [https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=8302.msg83713;topicseen#msg83713](https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=8302.msg83713;topicseen#msg83713) (2014).
