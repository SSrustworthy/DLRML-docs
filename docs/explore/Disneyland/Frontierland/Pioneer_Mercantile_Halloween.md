Not much is known about this loop, other than this MouseBits thread: [https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=9163.msg87015#msg87015](https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=9163.msg87015#msg87015) The only information I have is that at least part of the loop was edited directly from the "Happy Haunting" Sing Along Songs VHS.
