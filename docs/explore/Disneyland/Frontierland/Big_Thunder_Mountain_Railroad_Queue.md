See MouseBits, [https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=8066.msg72961#msg72961](https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=8066.msg72961#msg72961) and [https://disneymusicloops.tripod.com/dlr/dlr-front-btm.html.](https://disneymusicloops.tripod.com/dlr/dlr-front-btm.html.) Additional note from Djali999: Tracks did randomly pop in and out of loops in those days back when everything was being copied by hand onto reel-to-reel tapes which would degrade with time, so the missing tracks may or may not have been present at various points. This is the case most famously with the Big Thunder Mt queue loop, which is missing one track in Disneyland which was included in the Florida loop. The loops were supposed to be identical, but thanks to human error they were different for something like 20 years.
