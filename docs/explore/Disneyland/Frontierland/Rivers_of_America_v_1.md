# Rivers of America v.1

## Description

**Land(s)**: Frontierland

**Loop Total Length**: 01:00:16.014

Little is known concretely about when this loop played, although it is thought to have been installed around August of 1993. A brief clip of the loop playing in 1996 can be heard [https://youtu.be/e-jeX9HoIPM?t=1753](https://youtu.be/e-jeX9HoIPM?t=1753) in front of the HM. It is comprised entirely of recordings by the Royal Street Bachelors from sometime before 1978 as dated by a Jack Wagner Disneyland University training tape using some of the tracks. None of the tracks in this loop were released commercially in their complete form. However, an edited version of “Swanee River” by The Royal Street Bachelors has appeared on several OAs. See the MouseBits post, [https://www.notion.so/f7c80f10542145b3b326275f22b2a4d8?pvs=21](https://www.notion.so/f7c80f10542145b3b326275f22b2a4d8?pvs=21) (2022).
