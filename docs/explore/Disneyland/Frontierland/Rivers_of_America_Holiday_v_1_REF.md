This loop started playing in 2008 on the Rivers of America and was retired at the end of the 2014 holiday season. It likely also played in New Orleans on Royal Street during at least the 2007 holiday season, but whether it was this specific loop is unverified ([https://forums.mousebits.com/threads/roa-xmas-music.3350/post-22113,](https://forums.mousebits.com/threads/roa-xmas-music.3350/post-22113,) [https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/dl-holiday-loops.3986/post-28791,](https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/dl-holiday-loops.3986/post-28791,) [https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/disneyland-esplanade-christmas-music-loop-2008.3981/post-30520,](https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/disneyland-esplanade-christmas-music-loop-2008.3981/post-30520,) [https://forums.mousebits.com/threads/dl-holiday-music.2428/post-15361,](https://forums.mousebits.com/threads/dl-holiday-music.2428/post-15361,) [https://forums.mousebits.com/threads/the-dl-christmas-loop-thread.4845/post-35476](https://forums.mousebits.com/threads/the-dl-christmas-loop-thread.4845/post-35476)).

11. I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus – Magnolia Jazzband – Christmas Time with Magnolia Jazzband
- Loop Track Length: 02:44.485
- Track Notes: The TOC (Table Of Contents) on pixelated’s copy of the CD has an incorrect starting address for this track so a ripped track is missing some audio at its beginning.  I.e., the first ~0.170 secs. of the album track are actually at the end of the preceding album track, "Mitt Hjerte Alltid Vanker".  The following album track time indices are based on a repaired track that was created by adding the last 0.200 secs. of "Mitt Hjerte Alltid Vanker" to the beginning of "I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus".
The loop track starts at 00:00:00.026 of the repaired album track.  The section of the album track between 00:01:31.223 and 00:03:22.595 is deleted to remove applause and the loop track ends at 00:04:35.885 of the album track to omit a final drum & cymbal hit and applause.
