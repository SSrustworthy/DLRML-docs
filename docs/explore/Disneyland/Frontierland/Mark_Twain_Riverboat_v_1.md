## Description

**Land(s)**: Frontierland

**Loop Total Length**: 00:00:41.214

This was a loop of a single short, instrumental track over and over again behind live or recorded narration. It was somewhat slow and sad sounding. See MouseBits, [https://forums.mousebits.com/threads/the-music-of-the-mark-twain-riverboat.10846/](https://forums.mousebits.com/threads/the-music-of-the-mark-twain-riverboat.10846/) for an extensive discussion of this topic. The track is unreleased, but still plays today under the Disneyland Paris riverboat narration.
