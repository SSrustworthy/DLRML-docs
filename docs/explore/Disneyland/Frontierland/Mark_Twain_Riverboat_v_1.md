# Mark Twain Riverboat v.1

## Description

**Land(s)**: Frontierland

**Loop Total Length**: 00:00:41.214

This was a loop of a single short, instrumental track over and over again behind live or recorded narration. It was somewhat slow and sad sounding. See MouseBits, [https://dlrmusicloops.com/The-Music-of-the-Mark-Twain-Riverboat-a2c5513502234a28ae5f0c0c23bd59b4](https://dlrmusicloops.com/The-Music-of-the-Mark-Twain-Riverboat-a2c5513502234a28ae5f0c0c23bd59b4) for an extensive discussion of this topic. The track is unreleased, but still plays today under the Disneyland Paris riverboat narration.
