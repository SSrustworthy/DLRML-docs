Preliminary track list; presumed to have only played in 2012 in the Big Thunder Ranch area. “Most of the tracks have a long fadeout that runs up against the following track. I've noted where there are actual silent gaps between tracks.” See MouseBits, [https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=7066.msg67431#msg67431.](https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=7066.msg67431#msg67431.)
