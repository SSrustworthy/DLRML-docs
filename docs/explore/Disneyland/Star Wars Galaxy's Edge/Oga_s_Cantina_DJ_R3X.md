## Description

**Land(s)**: Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge

**Loop Total Length**: N/A

**Dates**: January 17, 2020

This is the show hosted by DJ R3X in Oga’s cantina. See my MouseBits post for an extensive post on this topic: [https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=10848.msg99013#msg99013](https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=10848.msg99013#msg99013) (2022). This loop repeats four times, with the interchangeable tracks changing each time. For convenience, I have only included one repetition of the loop here, with notes on the interchangeable tracks included in the Track Notes column.

It’s referred to as “Overload” because R3X’s introduction to the track either says that he finds a loose wire, or he says “Okay folks, here’s a jam I made up myself. I call it, Overload!!!” and then launches into a rehash of his lines from his Star Tours piloting days.
