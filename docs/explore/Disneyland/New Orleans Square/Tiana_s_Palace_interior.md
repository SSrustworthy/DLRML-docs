## Description

**Land(s)**: New Orleans Square

**Loop Total Length**: Unknown

Plays inside Tiana’s Palace most audibly by the main entryway. The loop is difficult to hear during business hours and so no recording or tracklist has been made yet. Kim Irvine according to the D23 blog has stated, “Our musicians at Walt Disney Imagineering put together a fabulous jazz score for inside the restaurant! It feels authentic to the space, and it adds an excited energy.”
