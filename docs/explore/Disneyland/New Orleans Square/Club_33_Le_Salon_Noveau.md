StarWarsGalaxysEdge noted: “Le Salon Nouveau features a Yamaha Disklavier (a reproducing piano) playing a mixture of jazz classics with a couple of Disney tunes thrown into the mix. I've noticed that its playback system does not follow the traditional "loop" model; rather, tracks can be shuffled and have smooth transitions between each other, almost as if a real person is playing the piano. Additionally, there is a prop instrument placed on each side of the bar — a trumpet and a clarinet — as well as in-ceiling speakers located on both sides of the room, which provide the appropriate trumpet/clarinet piece to whatever song the piano is playing. Although the piano is technically "live", there are a few speakers that broadcast the instrument throughout the lounge. All of the music that plays in the lounge was composed for the club”.
