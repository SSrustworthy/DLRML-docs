This custom queue loop began playing in the exterior garden area with the reopening of the Haunted Mansion in January 2025. Variations on a central track play in sync across the 4 different areas of the queue, which includes Master Gracey’s Garden, Madame Leota’s Garden, the Mansion Greenhouse, and the pet & residential cemeteries. The music was composed by [https://www.egoplum.com/.](https://www.egoplum.com/.) A sample of his work for the queue music is [https://soundcloud.com/laughing-place/haunted-mansion-new-queue-area-music-disneyland.](https://soundcloud.com/laughing-place/haunted-mansion-new-queue-area-music-disneyland.) Note, it is unverified whether there is a fourth section (as there are supposedly 40+ minutes of new music).
