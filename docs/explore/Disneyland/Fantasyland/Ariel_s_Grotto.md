4\. Wedding Announcement – The Little Mermaid OST



5\. Kiss the Girl (Calypso Version)

- Track Notes: Apparently this sounds very Syntho-Calypso; and is not the version on the TDS CD. The version used apparently sounds like it starts with a few bars of Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah. It is possible, though not confirmed, that this could be the same version used in several esplanade loops.

6\. Tour of the Kingdom – The Little Mermaid OST
