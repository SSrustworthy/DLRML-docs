According to junglecskipper: “The 4:16 IASW Area Music Loop was first played from 1966 until 1993 when the Paris music was installed. It was then brought back in 2003 when the original tracks were restored. It now plays as the queue music for all versions of the attraction except for Tokyo.” See MouseBits: [https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=3995.15](https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=3995.15) This is a loop consisting of several themes from the ride.
