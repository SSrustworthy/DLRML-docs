## Tracklist

1\. Sorcerer’s Dream 1071/1 – Paul Mottram – Magic, Ghosts, Mystery ANW 1071

- Track Notes: Has a short crossfade to the next track which omits the last ~27 secs of this track.

2\. Mystical Kingdom 1241/2 – Paul Mottram – Horror, Magic, Drama ANW 1241

- Track Notes: The source track has a fadeout and the loop track seems to have been dynamically compressed so the loop track's fadeout is shorter.  The start of the next track overlaps the fadeout by ~1 sec.

3\. Waltz on a Tightrope 1838/8 – Gerrit Wunder, Dorothee Badent – Cinematic ANW 1838

- Track Notes: The source track has a long fadeout (~3.7 secs.) that I can't hear in the recording but the next track starts after the fadeout.

4\. Sprites 1190/1 – Tim Garland – Magic, Mystery ANW 1190



5\. Magic Web 1598/5 – Dan Skinner, Adam Skinner – Rom Com & Family Movies ANW 1598

- Track Notes: This fades in with the "ladies and gentlemen..." announcement that the show is starting. Edited version of the track.
