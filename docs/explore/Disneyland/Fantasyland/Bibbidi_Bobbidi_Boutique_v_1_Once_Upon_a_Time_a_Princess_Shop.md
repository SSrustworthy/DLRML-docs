## Description

**Land(s)**: Fantasyland

**Loop Total Length**: Unknown

**Dates**: January 1, 2002

Karalora ID’d this loop when it was “Once Upon a Time…” and determined it to be identical when it was changed to Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique. She notes, “[T]he track order is extremely predictable. It starts with music from Snow White, goes through the original six Princess movies in chronological order, and then starts over (with one odd exception around the middle of the list). If there are no more Princess-y songs from a given movie, it skips that one in the remaining cycles.” See the [http://disneylanddilettante.blogspot.com/2016/01/the-second-sensearmchair-imagineering.html](http://disneylanddilettante.blogspot.com/2016/01/the-second-sensearmchair-imagineering.html) and MouseBits: [https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=8312.msg77332#msg77332.](https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=8312.msg77332#msg77332.)
