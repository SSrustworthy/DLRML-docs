# Merlin's Marvelous Miscellany [REF]

## Description

**Land(s)**: Fantasyland

**Loop Total Length**: 00:27:41.262

Merlin’s Marvelous Miscellany opened on March 11, 2022 in the Sleeping Beauty Castle Courtyard. The loop is audible from a couple of speakers in the “back” of the store, on the opposite side of the register. The loop has a runtime of 00:27:41.262 and is entirely comprised of instrumental score and song instrumentals from the Sleeping Beauty animated film. Unfortunately the loop contains a high amount of unreleased score, and so compiling a tracklist is all but impossible. I was able to cobble together the loop from fan-released extended soundtracks around the internet and the Legacy Collection release, with varying quality and SFX inclusion.
