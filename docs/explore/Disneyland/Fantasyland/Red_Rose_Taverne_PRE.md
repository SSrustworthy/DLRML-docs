The Red Rose Taverne took over Pinocchio’s Village Haus on February  24, 2017. See MouseBits, [https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=9503.msg90016#msg90016](https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=9503.msg90016#msg90016) (2017). It may be identical to the Magic Kingdom’s tavern loop, but this is unconfirmed. This track listing is the loop for New Fantasyland. There have definitely been tracks from their loop heard at the Red Rose Taverne.
