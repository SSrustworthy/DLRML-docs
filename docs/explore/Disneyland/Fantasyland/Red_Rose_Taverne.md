The Red Rose Taverne took over Pinocchio’s Village Haus on February  24, 2017. See MouseBits, [https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=9503.msg90016#msg90016](https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=9503.msg90016#msg90016) (2017). It is identical to the Magic Kingdom’s tavern loop, with slight speed differences, based on a 2024 recording from SSrustworthy. These tracks seem to be from a different recording session than the partial loop officially released by Tokyo Disneyland.
