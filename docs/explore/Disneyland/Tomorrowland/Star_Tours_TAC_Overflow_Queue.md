This is the overflow queue for Star Tours: The Adventures Continue. Discussed on MouseBits in [https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=9809.msg92388#msg92388.](https://mousebits.com/smf/index.php?topic=9809.msg92388#msg92388.) Most of these have odd little edits throughout, but appear to be from the original soundtracks. They seem to match the Special Edition releases for the original trilogy.
