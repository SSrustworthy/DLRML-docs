# Space Mountain Concourse v.2

## Description

**Land(s)**: Tomorrowland

**Loop Total Length**: ~00:28:32

This loop was an augmented version of the EPCOT Center 1982 entrance loop. It played ca. September 1986 when Space Stage was enclosed into the Magic Eye Theater/Captain EO to sometime in the nineties. The new Tomorrowland 2055 cues were recorded in 1991, so probably sometime after that point.
