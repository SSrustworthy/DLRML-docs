# Hyperspace Mountain Exit

## Description

**Land(s)**: Tomorrowland

**Loop Total Length**: ~5 minutes

The exit to Hyperspace Mountain appears to play “The Throne Room / End Title” from the Star Wars: A New Hope OST. This is audible on the exit staircase through the hallway that leads back to the concourse (where the restrooms and images are located). I don’t have a recording in full, but listened to a few videos and most of the first three minutes of the album track is covered. It is unknown whether edits are present.
