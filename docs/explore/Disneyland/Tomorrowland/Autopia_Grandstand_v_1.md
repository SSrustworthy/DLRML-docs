This loop played in the grandstand queue until March of 2017, when the new loop took over with the addition of Honda’s ASIMO/Bird. It played for the duration of Chevron’s sponsorship, during the sponsor-less period, and into the first year of Honda’s sponsorship. This listing is based on several recordings patched together from the 2010s.
