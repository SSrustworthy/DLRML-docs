## Tracklist

4. Upon the Housetop – Gary Parker & His Studio Sidemen – Country Christmas With Nashville Musicians
- Track Notes: Note, this track was released digitally as “Up on the Housetop” by The Fun Street Gang on the album Frosty and the Fun Street Gang (1979). The track is audibly identical to the version released by Gary Parker on his now-defunct website, albeit sped up significantly. The first several seconds of the digital track involve dialogue which also obscures the first ~4 seconds of the music, which is unobscured starting at 0:58.586 (I replaced the first few seconds with the lower-bitrate version from Gary Parker’s site). Loop playback rate is 0.743 of the digital source track. Using the Fun Street Gang version, edited to include 0:58.586 -1:37.541, 1:55.121-end with fade out around 2:10.777.
