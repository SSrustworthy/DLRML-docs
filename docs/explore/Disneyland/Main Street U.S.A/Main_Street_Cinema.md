The loop was probably compiled by Jack Wagner and installed in the 70’s. The vocal introductions were removed in 1983 when the Cinema switched to all Mickey Mouse shorts in 1983 ([https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/main-street-cinema-dl-playlist-and-question.4125/#post-30547](https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/main-street-cinema-dl-playlist-and-question.4125/#post-30547) and [https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/dlrp-main-street-music-what-is-it.1890/#post-12735](https://community.magicmusic.net/threads/dlrp-main-street-music-what-is-it.1890/#post-12735)).
