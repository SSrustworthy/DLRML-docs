7\. it's a small world (with vocals)

- Loop Track Length: 6:00.719
- Track Notes: Note from RocketRodsXPR: Paris underscore. Comes close to a version on Une Journee A Disneyland Paris, but only with a lot of editing (and mixing with portions of "Fantasyland - It's a Small World (AllVoices).mp3" which is/was available on a torrent here). It's doubtful Disney did as much work on this, so most likely there's an arrangement from a DLP release out there that I just don't happen to have in my collection.

14\. it’s a small world – Walt Disney and the 1964 World's Fair

- Loop Track Length: 1:52.6664
- Track Notes: Original track 21:24:547, and has a lot of edits. This arrangement uses first 32.479 seconds of the intro, then jumps to 51.337 seconds from the end. At 32.609 seconds from the original end, loops back to the 51.337 second mark for a second time through... then plays through the remainder of the track. Next track overplays final 3 seconds of silence. If you REALLY want an accurate version of the loop, replace the first three notes of the fade in with a matching portion that includes lyrics. During that initial fade-in, you can hear "It's a w--" of the verse before it cuts to a fully instrumental version.)
