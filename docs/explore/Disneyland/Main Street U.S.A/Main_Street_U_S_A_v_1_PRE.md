# Main Street U.S.A. v.1 [PRE]

## Description

**Land(s)**: Main Street, U.S.A.

**Loop Total Length**: Unknown

**Dates**: January 1, 1971 → November 1, 1975

This exact loop is unverified, but is here as a placeholder for 1971-1976. This was a short reel composed of the album “Gay Nineties Waltzes” that was initially created for WDW’s 1971 opening. An anecdote from DL FLIGHT 295 offers that it definitely featured “Man on the Flying Trapeze,” which was removed from the 1976 loops.

See the latter for links to digitally remastered versions. Again, this is very likely the WDW loop, but may not be the exact DL loop.
