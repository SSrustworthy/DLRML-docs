# The Disneyland Resort BGM Loops Database

## Welcome!

This is a thorough, though not comprehensive, database of background music (”BGM”) loops that have played at the Disneyland Resort, dating back to the opening of Disneyland. 

## Accessing Databases

You have three options:

1. You can access static pages for each loop using the **dropdown sidebar** to your left, or the **search bar** on the top of this site.

2. You can download a copy of all tracklists in markdown or CSV format by accessing the central [DLRML-docs](https://github.com/SSrustworthy/DLRML-docs) GitHub repository. All loops are concatenated into one giant table for each area (DL, DCA, or other resort properties).

3. You can check out the databases as hosted on [Notion](https://dlrmusic.notion.site/Databases-in-development-1ff45e88f3f4803f9bb9d97aab76784b) (where the previous version of the site was hosted). These are the development versions of the databases and are presented as filterable, sortable tables.

## New Additions

A log of new additions to the database is maintained on the [What's New?](news.md) page.

## Loop Notations

I have tried my best to note and link the original discussion posts for every loop. Many were compiled by community members on the MouseBits and Magic Music forums (see [Helpful Sources](../resources/helpful_sources.md)). My own research posts have been archived on this site [as well](../resources/helpful_sources.md).

As to the veracity of the loops, the track titles and artists are accurate to the best of the compiler’s ability. 

- Loops with [REF] in the title have been marked as checked against a reference recording and often have detailed information on edits and source albums. It should be otherwise assumed that the listing is a preliminary playlist.
  
  - Do keep this in mind before purchasing listed albums, as many loops were identified using TrackID, Shazam, Flairmax, Soundhound, Google Sound Search, and other music identification systems and therefore may not be from the correct album actually used in creating the park loop.

- The tag [PRE] marks presumed loops that presumed to have played in a given location. 

- Incomplete/partial loops are marked with [INC] and indicate that tracks are known to be missing. 

Unless otherwise noted, most loop track lengths are measured from the start of that track to the start of the following track, so any gap between tracks is included in that time.

## Finding Unreleased Music

Tracks labeled as unreleased indicate that they are (likely) proprietary music commissioned by WDI and have not been released to the public. However, that doesn’t mean they aren’t out there floating around somewhere! 

Many pre-2000 unreleased tracks can be found on the Disneyland Forever (DLF) and Walt Disney World Forever (WDWF) project torrents on [MouseBits](https://forums.mousebits.com/). The DLF project has also been separately uploaded to [Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/the-disneyland-forever-project). I highly recommend perusing the DLF descriptive PDF included with the project, as it is a wealth of information.
